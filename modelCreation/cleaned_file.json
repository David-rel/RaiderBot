three teachers participated in the jesuit global activism student leadership summit held virtually and coordinated by st louis university high school regis jesuit was one of 21 jesuit schools across 11 different time zones that took part in the summit which focuses on a common mission and vision to collaboratively explore solutions to the challenges and injustices we face as a global community reflection on the jesuit global activism student leadership summit by sofia rivera 24 this summer some students including myself were given the opportunity to change the world we all were lucky enough to participate in the 2022 jesuit global activism leadership summit which is geared to engage students from different countries to participate in an action to collaboratively explore solutions to the challenges and injustices we face as a global community more than 150 students came together over zoom from different countries and jesuit schools to create an inspiring community what personally drew me to join this program during my summer was the opportunity to be a part of something bigger it was crazy to believe that so many students from multiple backgrounds all believed that we need to change how we are living now to save our future and it was something i couldn t miss another rj student who also participated rhegan mccall 24 said i was really interested in being involved during the summer because it gave me the chance to meet many people from around the world which normally would be more difficult in the school year it also gave me the opportunity to spend much more time on the project my group was assigned to have an amazing product although it sounds like we got the hang of the different time zones quickly there were definitely some fears in the beginning what was most terrifying to me was the pressure to create a project with a group of strangers that could make an impact on the world all in a week but we have all proven that it can certainly be done on the first day i already learned at least one thing from everyone in my group everyone was so kind and respectful not to mention their english was almost better than mine it was exciting to see how easy it was to communicate with someone who was completely different than me one of the coolest things i learned was from my teammate lorenzo his school is actively taking steps into lowering its usage of emission gasses and it inspired me to see what i can do here at regis jesuit every participant chose a universal apostolic preference uap group to focus on during the summit with 6 7 students working together to create an action plan that is special to their uap the four uaps are showing the way to god walking with the excluded journeying with youth and caring for our common home my group chose caring for our common home and created a presentation on different reusable energies that could be used to inform global leaders the most significant thing that i learned from my group s uap is that even small actions that help the fight against global warming are important you don t have to donate thousands of dollars a month to an organization that recycles although that would be outstanding but reducing your plastic usage also makes a difference fellow rj student rhiann johnson 24 who also focused on the same uap stated now that i ve participated i see myself having a more conscious behavior of how much i take from the environment around me i m more aware of how much electricity and water i use as well as the people around me i ve started using led lights around my house because they use less energy and have started filtering my water so i don t use as much as students we need to understand that we are the future if we want to continue to live in the beautiful environment we have today we must lead by example i ask that students around the world realize that if you start to use less plastic walk more than drive take those above and beyond steps people will notice then they can join you and more and more people will start to care for our earth you don t realize how huge the jesuit community actually is until you see it i only saw a small piece of the jesuit connection but it was heartwarming to know that there are other people that share the same ideas and want to be and do better together i learned so much about the challenges millions face around the world i dove deep into new perspectives and was able to meet so many nice students i really am grateful for this opportunity and hope to share it with others next year back sofia rivera 24 l r ms

lyric swift 23 and reza moaddeli 23 share their reflections on their experiences from this year and the importance of this annual event diversity day has got to be one of the peak regis jesuit experiences and is a day that we look forward to as soon as the school year begins it is an amazing experience where we all come together as one community to learn about new things it is a day that is not just for the student body but also for the faculty to gain a new and fresh perspective by hearing the stories that people are willing to share with us though both juniors we had slightly different experiences this year as one of us was purely a participant and one was a workshop presenter both experiences offered us opportunities to grow the keynote speakers are always intriguing and really set the tone for the day we still remember the keynote from freshman year sr helen prejean sr helen is a pro life activist who speaks against the death penalty her speech was a powerful life lesson on the importance of human life the compassion sr helen has for every person is an admirable trait that we can all learn from this year we hosted ms gloria purvis who had a very similar message ms purvis is an african american author commentator and host of the gloria purvis podcast hosted by america media she spoke to us about the intersectionality of supporting the black lives matter movement and being pro life she was very clear that both deal with the importance of human life she was equally clear that we all bring so many things to who we are as people diversity day is truly one of the parts of regis jesuit that teaches the whole person the keynote speakers share things that we are going through and already have encountered in our day to day lives we are introduced to ideas that come from a variety of cultures and perspectives on things we have been taught and those that are outside of our normal experiences but everything touches on who we are as humans in this world beyond the keynote we love the different options for the great workshop sessions diversity day allows us to engage in if there is a topic you d like to learn more about there is most likely a workshop for it getting the chance to be with our friends pick great sessions and learn about new things all in one day makes it exciting we often wish diversity day was diversity week instead because there are so many good workshops it is hard to choose just three we stressed picking our workshops this year until we remembered that it s not about what sessions you pick you could pick the worst one and still have a great experience because you get out what you put into it diversity day teaches you that everyone s story is different and everyone has challenges that help them get where there are we learned that in all our sessions this year lyric s reflection one of the things that challenged me to grow during diversity day besides being presented with all the new ideas and possibilities was stepping out of my comfort zone and picking sessions that my friends were not attending i knew that if i picked different sessions it would help me focus and also grow because i would not be worried about what my friends are doing one of the workshops that really resonated with me this year was real life conversations with mrs ames it was a panel discussion with several people who willingly shared their stories and the lesson that they learned from their experiences it was really powerful the main lesson that i learned was that you cannot let your past define you what you can do is start where you are now and continue from there to make a better life for yourself it is never too late to change your life you just have to have the courage to try reza s reflection leading a workshop this year was amazing in november i went to washington dc for the ignatian family teach in for justice iftj with a group of students from regis jesuit iftj is a gathering of students from all over the country who are committed to working for justice as our catholic faith calls us to do at iftj we listened to a speech from fr bryan massingale a priest who works at fordham university and is a leader in the field of theological ethics he spoke on wage gaps and the ways that the gap affects black vs white americans differently fr massingale shared about a game he plays with his college students that is a spin off of monopoly depending on the piece you choose at the beginning you are assigned a predetermined set of money and social setbacks the idea is to simulate how in america depending on whether you are born white or nonwhite you are extended different privileges and amenities after we returned from the teach in this year our delegation decided to offer a workshop at diversity day to share this game with our peers and then have a conversation about it after we played a round of the game our discussion was awesome it was nice to see the students recognize how unfair things can be for some people even after we leave regis jesuit diversity day will always be one of the things that we remember because it is simply amazing it is truly inspiring and we are excited to be a part of the planning next year as seniors back back next"

immersion solidarity program immersion experience reflections the impact of immersion encounters 4 20 2022 christina ortiz director of the ignatian immersion solidarity program after a two year hiatus due to the pandemic this spring regis jesuit again sent our juniors and seniors into the community to engage in immersion experiences formerly known as service projects around the metro denver area as part of the school s ignatian immersion solidarity program iis which is supported by an endowed fund begun with last year s lark paddle raiser program director christina ortiz shares this reflection on changes to the program and the insights and impacts these experiences held during junior senior immersions i found myself on the phone with one of the directors at chelsea place a memory care facility that was hosting junior volunteers at the time we were discussing logistics but before i got off the phone she said i want you to know that your students are doing amazing here the staff has been taken aback by all of them in particular one of your junior boys for the last few days we have found him just sitting with one of our nonverbal residents holding her hand when we asked him if she was talking at all he smiled and told us we communicate in different ways it is quite the sight to see a teenage boy one who looks like he is probably on the football team sitting in silence with one of our elders just holding hands this has been one of the primary images from immersions this year that stuck with me in the vision for the iis program we state that this program exists to dissolve real and perceived barriers between our students and the wider global interconnected world dissolving those barriers requires so much of our students humility flexibility patience presence and vulnerability to name a few working with vulnerable populations such as the elderly the poor the unhoused the disabled requires our students to let go of preconceived notions about others and about the world and to put relationship first perhaps the hardest lesson they have to learn is how to be present to people before you try to do anything for them this year we were not only able to return to our traditional program of sending all 800 juniors and seniors out into the community but we also began a new tradition of hosting a few small groups of students for an overnight immersion two groups of seniors and one group of juniors each committed to a truly immersive experience as they spent an entire week away from their families and friends and instead spent their evenings praying together and reflecting on what they had seen learned each day at their sites the seniors worked with bal swan preschool which serves a combination of children with special needs and typical needs in westminster the juniors volunteered at tennyson center a school and program for at risk youth who come from abusive and traumatic backgrounds there are many stages of growth our students go through as they process their immersion experiences many such as sawyer mcfarland 23 start by reflecting on the privileges of their own upbringing working with these kids all week and learning about their stories have put things into perspective for me i may complain about a test or a bad grade while these kids are just looking to be loved and cared for everyone has their own struggles and challenges but it is important to notice the people who have to fight to be loved i am very fortunate to be loved and cared for beyond just appreciating what they have though we hope that our students are inspired to act to make the world a better place katelyn nelson 23 thinks a key part of that is overcoming self i was able to overcome myself this week at the tennyson center by growing in patience persistence and openness to love by the end of the week my perspective that our job as volunteers was to directly help the kids developed into the perspective that our main job was to support them on their journey molly nichols 23 learned that embracing uncomfortable experiences is crucial to loving others it was an intimidating environment and i didn t feel comfortable not once i think though that that is the point of immersion she goes on to say that she had to learn to see people for their whole authentic selves rather than stand in judgment at how they carry their own cross across the broken path they ve been placed on perhaps the most unexpected part of immersions for our students is learning how much they themselves long to be accepted and loved high school can feel like a very unforgiving unkind place for many teenagers many of them struggle with the feelings of not being enough whether that s in the classroom on the field or the stage or in the hallways in their day to day lives though they feel they must hide those insecurities and bury them deep enough inside so that no one can see them the very idea of being a vulnerable person though means that their insecurities and shortcomings are right on the surface for everyone to see as our students engage with the kind generous patient and oftentimes hilarious guests clients at their sites they learn how much strength can be found in vulnerability before immersions start we ask our students to reflect on their feelings going in almost all of them express a fear that they won t be good enough for their site or that they won t know how to help on the first day they are amazed at how welcome they feel right away some are greeted by young children who immediately want to be their best friend no questions asked others are welcomed to conversations and activities with guests clients and they are surprised that they are the ones being taken care of rather than the other way around rahel seyoum 23 reflected early in her immersion in my family it s tradition for the children to sit at a separate table during the holidays when i was younger all i wanted was a seat at the table to be an integral part of something bigger than myself and to have a space where i could voice my opinions without fear as i grew older this desire manifested in a need for diversity and inclusion without the toll of discrimination and without the need for conformity today i got a seat at the table today i became a part of something larger than myself today i spent time with three of the most amazing and inspiring black men that i have ever met i look up to these men and i am grateful that today they offered me a seat at the table so much of the human experience is rooted in a desire to belong to feel that someone genuinely cares immersions are just a little reminder for our students that there is a place for everyone at god s table back back next"

22 and rylie ward 21 were joined by faculty members ginger brown john johnson mary muldoon chris vela for this year s event delegate matthew tierney 22 shared his thoughts on the experience learn more about rj s effort to gain consultative status with the united nations on our experience at csw by matthew tierney 22 going into the united nations commission on the status of women csw i was excited to see how the international perspectives on women s issues might overlap with the issues we students are confronted within a high school setting despite the limitations placed on our group by coronavirus related circumstances we had to attend the presentations online we walked away with a wealth of knowledge on international women s issues and the struggle to eliminate them as well as a greater sense of solidarity and appreciation for activists in several different countries while it was interesting learning about the unique problems women face around the world like child marriage the most powerful presentations were often those transcending geography for instance csw forced us to confront head on the gendered manifestations of digital violence regardless of location digital harassment violence and exploitation are burgeoning issues and multiple csw presenters stressed the difficulty of enforcing laws online many members of our group myself included also sat in on presentations that dealt with the intersection of women s issues and labor we learned from labor activists and researchers of the exacerbated exploitation that women particularly those in the global south face at the workplace one such presentation focused on the working conditions fueling the fast fashion industry one that as high school students and americans we are often on the consuming end of fueled by a hyper exploited workforce largely in southern countries like bangladesh this industry is a perfect example of this intersection of women s and labor issues i was struck by the poignancy of this convergence in the presenter s description of the 2013 dhaka garment factory collapse that occurred after a largely female workforce s concerns over worker safety went ignored resulting in an industrial disaster and loss of human life that dwarfs the infamous triangle shirtwaist fire of 1911 between presentations our group held fruitful conversations about the issues that had been presented specifically we discussed how we could incorporate knowledge from the csw into our own community at regis jesuit on digital violence particularly we felt that we could do more as a school combating it through education we recognized that direct engagement with topics like sexual harassment that in past years might have been covered through the advisement program or assemblies had to be tabled given the circumstances of the pandemic so we brainstormed ways to strengthen education on issues of sexism at regis jesuit beyond changes on the school level as students our crucial takeaway from this experience is the idea that we all have a responsibility to work towards a more just society when it comes to women as a middle class american and in my case as a man i am often sheltered from the worst symptoms of the global situation that i in many ways benefit from at csw however i was exposed albeit in a detached academic setting to the struggles of women around the globe i also encountered a multitude of wonderful and dedicated people committed to making things better after we had attended the csw virtual presentations we had the privilege of meeting directly with the united states u n youth observer dustin liu he encouraged us to imagine the world you want the csw made it powerfully clear that we all have a responsibility and the right to imagine a better world and the responsibility for creating that world rests on all of us back matthew tierney 22 matthew tierney 22 back next"

jesuit community during quarantine especially the faculty staff and seniors it has shown me god s ability to bring consolation to moments that are so easily marked as times of desolation the amount of joy the drive thru microsoft teams meetings volunteer opportunities daily prayers counselor check ins and small yet enormously impactful texts have brought me and all members of the community has outshone the darkness they remind me of my gratitude toward all the experiences and people of regis who have impacted my life eternally and the things i normally take for granted i know that next time i hug a friend i will take the time to truly appreciate the gift of their embrace and of their presence in my life i know that i am forever thankful for the power and gift of words because they allow me to tell someone how beautiful they are and how much they mean to me i know that when all of the rj community can come fully together again i will rejoice in the sisterhood and brotherhood of the community as the infamous tony stark of marvel s avengers once stated part of the journey is the end though i have struggled to embrace this concept what has given me more comfort is the fact that the journey is not just comprised of the end once it is over it is made up of all those moments good and bad that made it so monumental it is made up of the memories that will last us a lifetime and more and it is made up of how we continue to be what we have learned to be from the journey itself long after it has ended my time in the physics classroom has led me to pursue a path in medicinal physics being part of the cross country track and swim teams has helped me decide to run in college kairos has allowed me to see that i am loved exactly for who i am taught me how to love others and god more fully and convinced me that i am a leader my teachers and peers in grades above or below me have shown me that meaningful relationships can look so different than i once imagined this quarantine has proved to all of us our ability to lift each other out of the dark the journey we have been on these past four years may be coming to a close but the unexpected manner in which it does will not define what we take away from it over the past four years isalina has been part of regis jesuit s cross country swim dive and track field teams as well as a member of the fiat and cadre clubs she will be attending the university of notre dame next fall where she plans to study physics into medicine _______________ the final lesson ryan tierney 20 on thursday march 12 at 2 45 pm regis jesuit s bell rang like any other day it dismissed students and signaled the end of classes but on that particular day things were different coronavirus took the united states by storm the nba suspended its season chsaa suspended all sports and activities and multiple school districts across the denver metro area declared cancelations during my ap macroeconomics class mr tricco emailed the school and announced that we would not be returning that friday as the clock ticked down during the second half of class everyone stood watching the news from their ipads or phones no one in that class or throughout the school was paying attention to their final lesson the moment was surreal in hindsight i suppose that last bell signaled a lot more than the end of the day it signaled the end of four years for the senior class the end of walks down the hall with friends the end of sports and activities the jeopardization of a normal conclusion to the senior experience the final lesson which marked the end of our time in high school passed by without fanfare for me it was demoralizing as it signified the abrupt conclusion to morning swim practices saturday team breakfasts and all the other parts of my final high school swim season we at rj are not alone across the country hundreds of thousands of high school and college students have had the pomp and circumstance of their senior year robbed by covid 19 for four years the class of 2020 and i have grown immensely under the care and teaching of regis jesuit like at other high schools we have grown in intellect but a raider education is rooted in care for the whole person so we have also developed in our faith in our commitment to the wellbeing of others and in our capacity to love the victory lap for seniors with prom the senior book drop yearbook signing and graduation is a way for us to present that growth to the world with this taken away it can be easy to fall into despair and lamentation it can be easy on some level to resent the scientists telling us that it is not safe to convene in public it can be easy to grow irritated at public officials ordering us to stay home and away from school it can even be easy to minimize the incredible risk that the virus poses to the elderly those with pre existing conditions and the general populace sadly many high schools and students have fallen into this trap in recent days especially with the gradual reduction of lockdown protocols across the country but what makes regis special and what i believe has allowed our school to avoid this trap is that at its core the school imparts one value self sacrificial love this love is demonstrated most in the dedication and care of the regis jesuit teachers many of whom over four years have earned my utmost respect however in addition to them the retreat program service projects theology curriculum and general world philosophy that guides all rj activities is rooted in the idea that if our brothers are oppressed then we are oppressed roosevelt that if they hunger we hunger roosevelt and that if jesus christ could give his life on the cross for us we can extend that love to our fellow humans it is this love to which we are all called of course it can manifest itself in countless ways from making yourself vulnerable to a loving spouse to serving the poor no matter what form it takes this love must be given wholeheartedly right now more than 80 000 people have died across the united states in the past three months from coronavirus while much of this may be out of our control through the sacrifice of our senior sunset which pales in comparison to the immense self sacrifice of the healthcare workers in this country we have been empowered to show love for our fellow humans and to prevent future casualties even though we may never be aware of their existence so while i wish that we could have had a normal end to this school year one rich with celebration and closure regis jesuit has prepared my classmates and me to be able to let that all go and be happy this was our final lesson ryan has been involved in numerous clubs and activities during his time at regis jesuit including the boys swim dive team national honor society mu alpha theta sports analytics club rj media advanced jazz ensemble the rowdies and cannonball club next year he will be attending harvard university where he will be swimming on the men s swim and dive team and pursuing a career in the united states navy through the naval rotc program back back next"

event delegate matthew tierney 22 shared his thoughts on the experience learn more about rj s effort to gain consultative status with the united nations on our experience at csw by matthew tierney 22 going into the united nations commission on the status of women csw i was excited to see how the international perspectives on women s issues might overlap with the issues we students are confronted within a high school setting despite the limitations placed on our group by coronavirus related circumstances we had to attend the presentations online we walked away with a wealth of knowledge on international women s issues and the struggle to eliminate them as well as a greater sense of solidarity and appreciation for activists in several different countries while it was interesting learning about the unique problems women face around the world like child marriage the most powerful presentations were often those transcending geography for instance csw forced us to confront head on the gendered manifestations of digital violence regardless of location digital harassment violence and exploitation are burgeoning issues and multiple csw presenters stressed the difficulty of enforcing laws online many members of our group myself included also sat in on presentations that dealt with the intersection of women s issues and labor we learned from labor activists and researchers of the exacerbated exploitation that women particularly those in the global south face at the workplace one such presentation focused on the working conditions fueling the fast fashion industry one that as high school students and americans we are often on the consuming end of fueled by a hyper exploited workforce largely in southern countries like bangladesh this industry is a perfect example of this intersection of women s and labor issues i was struck by the poignancy of this convergence in the presenter s description of the 2013 dhaka garment factory collapse that occurred after a largely female workforce s concerns over worker safety went ignored resulting in an industrial disaster and loss of human life that dwarfs the infamous triangle shirtwaist fire of 1911 between presentations our group held fruitful conversations about the issues that had been presented specifically we discussed how we could incorporate knowledge from the csw into our own community at regis jesuit on digital violence particularly we felt that we could do more as a school combating it through education we recognized that direct engagement with topics like sexual harassment that in past years might have been covered through the advisement program or assemblies had to be tabled given the circumstances of the pandemic so we brainstormed ways to strengthen education on issues of sexism at regis jesuit beyond changes on the school level as students our crucial takeaway from this experience is the idea that we all have a responsibility to work towards a more just society when it comes to women as a middle class american and in my case as a man i am often sheltered from the worst symptoms of the global situation that i in many ways benefit from at csw however i was exposed albeit in a detached academic setting to the struggles of women around the globe i also encountered a multitude of wonderful and dedicated people committed to making things better after we had attended the csw virtual presentations we had the privilege of meeting directly with the united states u n youth observer dustin liu he encouraged us to imagine the world you want the csw made it powerfully clear that

athletics game tickets alumni calendar my admissions mission student experience community support rj inspire ignite 2025 summer programs work at rj apply visit inquire give day 5 in memphis 2 9 2023 by john reasbeck 23 jacob simpson 23 ben scharbach 23 and ethan gremmert 23 we broke into three groups this morning to give hospitality to our neighbors at manna house dorothy day house and mid south food bank the adults surprised the group with a trip to the bass pro pyramid we all loved it and then we divided our cooking and cleaning responsibilities to serve one more meal at room in the inn we re in the sacred space of wanting to go home but also not wanting to leave a reflection from john reasbeck wow the last day and here i am watching all my new friends clean our basement bunker while i get to type away this morning 3 of us got a 7 15 wake up call and i got to enjoy a nice trip to the manna house i had 0 clue what to expect walking into this beautiful place but i was in for a great morning manna house provides coffee and clothing for those in need of it but most of all a friendly and warm smile i got to converse with some neighbors who all have very unique perspectives on life no matter how old or young they may be some neighbors struggle more then others but through all of that i noticed that manna house seemed to provide a way to help boost a poor mood to a good one i got the chance to develop new relationships and immerse myself in what a day might look like for someone else this opportunity opened my eyes and gave me perspectives that i have never thought of before being able to provide warmth with a hot cup of coffee or a conversation was so meaningful to a lot of people but especially myself because of those reasons places like manna house are truly a light in a community struggling with darkness and it truly shows in the work that the workers and volunteers do i recognized how much time and effort goes into every detail and it s really amazing that people sacrifice themselves for the well being of others and to bear weight that those struggling may be dealing with every day in memphis has been so eye opening but i m so fortunate to be able to get the chance to give my gifts to manna house a reflection from jacob simpson today has been a day we have had before but still makes the same impact no matter how many times you experience it the feeling of joy when you are able to help someone that has asked for help and you were able to give without question or thought is amazing today we worked in the kitchen at room in the inn and i was able to help those people in need there we worked to prepare the food arriving earlier than guests to make sure they were able to just sit down and enjoy side note they make a big emphasis on saying guest and not customers something i think makes the guest feel more at home and welcome anyways i was working throughout the late afternoon to make the beans that were going to be served alongside the other thing that tacos are comprised of after the meal was ready i helped to serve and bring out the food to the guests on one of my trips to some of the more longtime guests at the inn i found a man looking a tad bit lost and carrying a coffee i approached the man asking how he was doing he responded saying he was heading back to his room and was just trying to find it i walked with him through the hallways talking about how he had lived in california and had to move because he couldn t afford to live there he had been in memphis for about a year now and was just having a hard time finding a job because of his age we eventually made it back to the room and he said thank you for talking with him and the most people he meets that didn t really want to hear what his story was a reflection from ben scharbach today three of us woke up early to immerse ourselves in a fun day at manna house at first i felt uncomfortable but then slowly got the hang of it i was separated from the group and went to assist the guests with their showers i would assist them by exchanging their clothes for new ones while doing that i started making conversations with the guests and really got to understand their situation and why they are stuck there i would ask many questions and make personal connections with them while listening to the guests i would see the emotions flow with their words and really understand them and their situations at the end of my time there i went outside and really saw how great of a community it is there everyone s problems were different but at the end they were all sharing coffee and stories and really being a community seeing this made me conscious that no matter how difficult life can get creating a safe space will bring a sense of peace and comfort a reflection from ethan gremmert so you guys going to college a short silence was followed by people around the table casually saying yes i waited sat there and then eventually followed the crowd with my own yea as i think now i wonder why i paused the kid was only in the eighth grade and i sat there a twelfth grader disoriented by a question about my future it was a question that i would have casually responded to if i was talking to one of my mom s friends or a relative but at this moment i did not i had waited but for what because the question caught me off guard because i thought everyone else would start answering no i think i paused because i felt uncomfortable not with the question but with the thoughts that the kid i was talking to might never get the chances we had college seems like such an inevitable occurrence to me but in that moment i felt it was different for him it seemed as if he had so much curiosity and at that moment i was struck the ideas of privilege and opportunity have constantly floated around my mind on this trip experiencing and interacting with people who are experiencing homelessness and poverty along with seeing those who are being helped by organizations and groups has shown me my privilege and other s suffering i had felt emotions like this before when doing service or seeing a person experiencing homelessness in colorado but throughout this trip they have been magnified somehow i feel that my experience here has been more impactful and transformative for me than in the past before coming and seeing memphis the first thoughts i had about it either involved the grizzlies or barbeque but now i see a great community it may be struggling but i feel that we have made a real impact for many people it s definitely made an impact on me back back next"

athletics game tickets alumni calendar my admissions mission student experience community support rj inspire ignite 2025 summer programs work at rj apply visit inquire give day 2 in memphis 2 6 2023 by eva halker 23 karl emery angbanzan 23 amery galan 23 and renee sobania 23 we spent the morning at two sites serving people experiencing homelessness manna house and room in the inn we loved being in the community today and working alongside and for our memphis neighbors we ate lunch together and then headed to the national civil rights museum we finished the evening with local bbq soul food and a walk down historic beale street what a day a reflection from eva halker today i felt very surprised at the manna house with the community that was built and how the community welcomed us antonio a nice young man using the manna house to take a shower was surprised that we were from colorado and made a point to welcome us to memphis and thank us for the service we are doing for the city it was encouraging to see first hand the people we were helping and the impact big or small that we had to help their day run a little smoother we worked with regular volunteers and listened to their stories of memphis and saw the relationships that they had made with the people they help i was impressed by the respect that the guests have for the manna house because of the importance that it holds in their lives and the help that they receive every week from them we then went to the civil rights museum and many of us were overwhelmed by the brutality shown towards humans we learned and experienced the sight of dr martin luther king s execution at the lorraine motel i was inspired by a lady who used to live in the motel who now protests every day on the street for what she believes in finally i found joy in the culture of memphis walking down beale street and taking in the bright street signs and exciting atmosphere after our tiring dance party to a local jazz band we were surprised by delicious cookies a reflection karl emery angbanzan today was a very enriching day filled with culture joy and companionship among us and the community of memphis we started the day at room in the inn where we learned about the inn and also cleaned some of the rooms the mission and purpose of the organization is very inspiring and pays homage to the strong community of memphis my favorite part of the day and probably the entire trip was the national civil rights museum there was a certain feeling that was amplified by the scenes which depicted where dr martin luther king was shot and killed i loved the integration of the motel and the museum as it made the experience feel very surreal as i was walking on the grounds of what once was the center of a truly horrific site seeing that my classmates were just as much awe as i was further affirmed the feeling we ended the night with a stroll through downtown memphis and it was a site to see we were introduced to a little spot where a band was playing live music and let me tell you it was a party the pure joy and community in the moment is something i ll never forget for the rest of my life a reflection from amery galan today was an incredible day filled with learning laughter love and building relationships i started my day at the manna house and at first the group and i were feeling anxious we didn t know how the community would feel about us coming into volunteer shortly after our arrival we heard a man yell excitedly hey look new volunteers we helped around the manna house serving coffee getting clothes to people and just talking with the guests what surprised me most about working with the people in the manna house was their resilience and bright outlook on life even though they didn t have much they were happy to be there and to be with us after lunch we went to the national civil rights museum which was truly a learning opportunity for the class it was as if we went back in time when we walked up to the museum because the lorraine motel where martin luther king jr was assassinated was the front of the building everyone has seen images of the lorraine motel but to be there and see where mlk died gave lots of us chills the museum was amazing but also terribly sad to end the night we all went on a stroll down beale street we stopped to dance to the amazing live music of the real deal cowboy neal it was an incredible way to end the day by dancing singing and laughing with all my classmates a reflection from renee sobania on our second day in memphis we were able to start our service to the memphis community and learn more about the history of the city our morning started at a place called room in the inn we met with terri the volunteer coordinator she gave us a bit of background about the organization she explained that the building used to be a hospital which was transformed into a place for people or families who needed a place to stay in order to get off the streets this hospital used to be one of the only hospitals that accepted black patients or allowed black doctors to work this organization really wanted to keep the history of the hospital alive and honor its service by keeping the original structure and design of the building another great thing about room in the inn is they truly focus on helping the families and people there they have two floors with two separate sections one section of the building was for families and the other section was for guests from recuperative care i loved that they only accepted a few guests at a time so that they were able to find a more permanent location to live or so the recuperative care patients had enough time to recover so they could care for themselves while they take fewer guests they try their best to ensure that they have time to get back on their feet so they can stay off the streets after terri talked to us half of us worked to clean up the kitchen and dining area while the other half went to clean up a room for two new families while this job didn t seem like much to us this small act of cleaning a room or mopping a floor will allow for a new family to move into a nice clean room and for the guests to enjoy their meal in a clean dining area the next part of our day we ventured to the civil rights museum this was probably one of the coolest museums i have ever been to we were able to see the exact location that martin luther king jr was assassinated at the lorraine motel they had completely transformed the hotel into a beautiful museum which showed the many years of oppression slavery and discrimination that african american people have experienced for centuries we were also able to see the spot where mlks assassin stood when he shot him i thought this was an incredible museum and i encourage anyone who travels to memphis to visit after the museum we headed back to the bunker and had some of the best bbq i have ever had after our reflection we went out onto beale street while it was a monday night and not very busy we had a great time singing and dancing to a live jazz band called the real deal cowboy neal this was the highlight of my trip so far and i can t wait for what else is to come in memphis back back next"

2023 by winnie eller 23 jovany espinoza 23 and josiah harris 23 winnie jovany and josiah share their ups and downs at the tennyson center from the past 3 days now at the half way mark for this fully immersed week they also share how they have adjusted and fit in not only at the shared airbnb but in each of the kid s and staff s everyday schedule winnie eller on the first day at the tennyson center for children i was assigned to work with middle school boys with mental and or learning disabilities and i ll say that i was not the most excited person in the world to work with them i walked into classroom 206 and was greeted with several staff members and only 2 kids in the room most of the day i sat back and observed so i could get a grasps of the schedule and what rules were in place but i was able to make some quick connections and conversations with a few of the student as the day went on the second day i was hit with the harsh reality of what this class was going to be like arguments and rude comments up in the air schedules and watching multiple movies a day but i was hopeful for what was to come since i got to meet more students and play games with each of them today was the first with no crazy events and i probably spent about 4 hours in total playing a math pizzeria game with the students answering about 95 of those math questions however the most impactful part of this experience so far has been that the class of 206 has been known to be a handful in the nicest way possible and that their reputation has turned away many volunteers but so far the children in class 206 have been well behaved 95 of the time and are usually willing to do they work that needs to be done i ve gotten to experience first hand the difference between reputation and actuality and it has opened me to changing my perspective on other groups as well these past 3 days have made me really hopeful for the next week and a half and i can t wait to get to know both the students and staff members of the tennyson center even better jovany espinoza arriving the week of immersions i had no idea of what to expect but right as i took my first step into the class i felt unknown i had no clue what would come from me and and those around while i was sitting in the back of the class i was waiting for the right opportunity to get myself into the rhythm of the class but at times the right opportunity never comes but the unexpected does i soon see a little kid start to turn around slowly and as soon as we made eye contact he gives me the simplest gesture a nod right then and there i felt noticed and even though i was in the back of the room i acknowledged the energy of every single person in the class at times many people overthink about being liked or wondering what those around are thinking but from my experience it is never about fitting in but about being accepted for who you are day 4 has been completed and i have turned my focus on those around me and now almost a whole week with people who i can honestly call friends has made me come to a conclusion friendships are not about who you have known the longest they re about about those who walk into your life unexpectedly and say i am here for you it took me a long time to know what real friends are worth and i can say this experience has done nothing but good to me hoping that the job i am doing now can go a long way and change those around me josiah harris coming into tennyson i truly didn t know what to expect i was nervous i didn t know how the children in the classroom would react to two random people suddenly come into their classroom for two weeks my first day i didn t know what i could do to help around the classroom i didn t know any of the students and i hardly spoke to any of the staff members towards the end of the day on monday i kindly asked a student if they would like to play connect 4 with me i noticed that it was their free time and he wasn t up to anything at all after being beat consistently for about 20 minutes this student and i found a way to connect through video games we talked about what games we liked and didn t like and what our favorite gaming device was on the second day the class spent a lot of time in the gym i was able to really fit in with the class when we all played basketball and football together the class is full of boys so sports was a great way for all of us to connect but as far as the two girls in the class there weren t many ways for us to connect finally on the third day i found out that one of the girl students and i both really enjoy an artist named j coles music we talked a lot about what our favorite songs were by him and other projects that he s made fitting in was never really a problem for me as a student when i was younger i was very shy and quiet but here at tennyson i had to be quite the opposite i have to be open to being able to reach out to others before they reach out to me back the denver immersion crew goes
