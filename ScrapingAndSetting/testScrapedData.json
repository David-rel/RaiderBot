We have the experience and skills to create robots that are tailored to the unique challenges in FIRST, and working on these projects gives our students the chance to develop valuable skills and knowledge. By designing and building robots, students gain hands-on experience with technology, critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork.\n\nWe're always looking for new and innovative ways to make our robots better. And our goal is to compete and succeed with creative robots and solutions, but our main focus is always helping students grow and succeed.\n\nTake a look around our website to learn more about our team and the amazing robots we've built in the past.\n\nOur Story\n\nRJ Robotics started not even with a robotics club. It started when 2 friends were in a Aerospace club. They then came up with the idea to start a robotics club in their own garage. A few years later It came to Regis in 2010. Our first ever competition was in 2011. It was a tough few years as they get the resources, money, and mentors to work but in the end they got it. There was about 20 students and 2 mentors during this time.\n\nToday our team is stronger than ever before. We have 40+ members now and a lot of amazing mentors. We strive to win every competition we attend and work hard every day to build even better robots than the year before. Our team has grown significantly and many more Leads, Co-leads, mentors, and other team members all make up this amazing team of ours.\n\nFIRST Robotics\n\nFIRST Robotics was founded in 1989 by inventor and entrepreneur Dean Kamen. The organization aims to inspire students in STEM fields through its robotics competition program. The competition tasks teams of high school students to design, build, and program robots to compete in various challenges, fostering teamwork, innovation, and a love of STEM. FIRST Robotics has grown to become a global organization with thousands of participating teams, and has become an important platform for promoting STEM education and careers.\n\nRJ Robotics, 3729\n6300 S Lewiston Way, Aurora, CO 80016\n(303) 269-8000\nemail: mmarchand@regisjesuit.com\nHome\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\nSchool Robots\n\n\n\nSponsors\n\n\n\nCompetition Scouter\n\n\n\nTeam Structure\n\n\n\nCreation Process\n\n\n\nScouter\n\n\n\nFIRST\n\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\nCalendar\n\n\n\nTeam Resources\nWEBSITE DISCLAIMER:\nThis is the team website for Regis Jesuit’s Robotics Team.
