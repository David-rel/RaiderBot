In all, more than 150 community members provided input and worked to validate the vision that will guide our efforts over the next five years.

Flexible spaces and cutting-edge technology will encourage collaboration and experimentation and elevate the educational experience for every student.\nCREATE\nWith an 8000-square-foot maker space and many hands-on tools, students will create prototypes with their own hands.\n\nFrom robotics and rocket science to new space for RJ Media and expanded facilities for studio art, metal work, greenhouses and more, students will have state-of-the-art spaces to create and display the things they imagine.

Mary McNicholas showed their children the importance of manners and creating a warm social environment for anyone who came to their door. The family built their Denver-based business on these values, forging deep connections with the people they employed and the people they partnered with, giving everyone the opportunity to create a better future for themselves.\nRead More\nThe Tierney Brothers: Sacrifice, Spirit and Service\nLong before Ryan ’20 Tierney (in red jacket on left) or his brother Matthew ’22 (in red jacket on right) were old enough to attend Regis Jesuit, the family had become deeply immersed in the idea. Through the summer swim team in Castle Pines, they knew Teddy ’15 and John ’17 Koerner, who went on to graduate from Pomona College and Columbia University respectively. And they knew about Jackson Fox ’13, another swimmer, who works as a consultant at Deloitte, after graduating from Notre Dame. \n\nFinancially, Regis Jesuit was an ambitious choice for the Tierneys, but thanks to financial aid, their boys were able to dive right in. As student-athletes dedicated to serving others, they’ve made quite the splash.\nRead More\nMike Armistead '82: Listening, Learning and Giving Back\nAbout a year ago, Mike Armistead ’82, a successful serial entrepreneur, posted a blog to the website for Respond Software, where, at the time, he was CEO and co-founder.

These Universal Apostolic Preferences or UAPs, which were developed by Jesuits and worldwide mission partners and approved by Pope Francis, will guide discernment in all Jesuit communities and institutions as they determine where they will focus their energies and resources, how they will make decisions and whom they will serve.\n\nThe UAPs, visualized and linked below, encourage all in the Ignatian Family to bring others to a better relationship with God through Ignatian Spirituality, to accompany all those who are poor or excluded in society, to foster hope among our young people and to work toward solutions for protecting our world as stewards of God’s creation.

Regis Jesuit was one of 21 Jesuit schools across 11 different time zones that took part in the summit, which focuses on  a \"common mission and vision to collaboratively explore solutions to the challenges and injustices we face as a global community.\"\n\nReflection on the Jesuit Global Activism Student Leadership Summit\nBy Sofia Rivera '24\n\nThis summer, some students including myself were given the opportunity to CHANGE THE WORLD! We all were lucky enough to participate in the 2022 Jesuit Global Activism Leadership Summit which is geared to engage students from different countries to participate in an action to collaboratively explore solutions to the challenges and injustices we face as a global community. More than 150 students came together over Zoom from different countries and Jesuit schools to create an inspiring community.\nRead More\nDIVERSITY DAY 2022 REFLECTIONS\n4/20/2022\nThis year's Diversity Day took place on March 8, 2022. Students Lyric Swift '23 and Reza Moaddeli '23 share their reflections on their experiences from this year and the importance of this annual event. \n\n\nDiversity Day has got to be one of the peak Regis Jesuit experiences and is a day that we look forward to as soon as the school year begins. It is an amazing experience where we all come together as one community to learn about new things. It is a day that is not just for the student body, but also for the faculty to gain a new and fresh perspective by hearing the stories that people are willing to share with us. Though both juniors, we had slightly different experiences this year as one of us was purely a participant and one was a workshop presenter. Both experiences offered us opportunities to grow.\nRead More\nTHE IMPACT OF IMMERSION ENCOUNTERS\n4/20/2022\nAfter a two-year hiatus due to the pandemic, this spring Regis Jesuit again sent our juniors and seniors into the community to engage in Immersion Experiences (formerly known as Service Projects) around the metro Denver area as part of the school's Ignatian Immersion & Solidarity Program (IIS), which is supported by an endowed fund begun with last year's LARK paddle raiser. Program Director Christina Ortiz shares this reflection on changes to the program and the insights and impacts these experiences held. \n\nDuring Junior-Senior Immersions, I found myself on the phone with one of the directors at Chelsea Place, a memory care facility that was hosting junior volunteers at the time. We were discussing logistics, but before I got off the phone she said, “I want you to know that your students are doing amazing here. The staff has been taken aback by all of them, in particular one of your junior boys. For the last few days, we have found him just sitting with one of our nonverbal residents, holding her hand. When we asked him if she was talking at all, he smiled and told us, ‘We communicate in different ways.’ It is quite the sight to see a teenage boy—one who looks like he is probably on the football team—sitting in silence with one of our elders, just holding hands.”\nRead More\nUN COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN CONFERENCE 2022\n3/28/2022\nIn March of this year, 16 students and two adults spent a week in March in both an online immersion experience with the global UN Commission on the Status of Women network and in person with Denver-area organizations that promote and support women. The delegation participated in webinars and online presentations throughout the conference, including a direct discussion with the UN Youth Ambassador, as well as visited and learned more about several local organizations that share in the mission of promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women.\nRead More\n17TH ANNUAL DIVERSITY DAY: TO SEE ALL THINGS NEW IN CHRIST\n3/14/2022\nOn March 8, 2022, we were thrilled to be able to return to hosting our annual Diversity Day Conference fully in-person after holding it completely online last year due to the pandemic. The day began with Gloria Purvis, author, commentator and podcaster for AMERICA Media, as the keynote speaker. She also spoke to a group of about 30 students at lunch and to more than 80 parents and other adults from across the metro area Catholic community in the evening, sharing her strong Catholic voice for life issues, religious liberty and racial justice with each group. \nRead More\nLATINOS UNIDOS AND SPANISH HONORS SOCIETY HOST LAS POSADAS\n12/16/2021\nThe Latinos Unidos and Spanish Honors Society clubs hosted an on-campus experience of Las Posadas, the traditional religious festival celebrated in Mexico, Latin America, Cuba and Spain, as well as by the Latino community in the U.S. Students were invited at lunch to three stations - one in each building - to sample traditional food and drink and learn more about the origins and cultural relevance of this celebration. A visit to each station earned them a stamp and those with three stamps were rewarded with candy and a swing at the piñata inside GD Tradition Hall.\nRead More\nLUPITA LOPEZ '22 EARNS FULL-RIDE TO COLLEGE THROUGH QUESTBRIDGE\n12/16/2021\nCongratulations to Lupita Lopez '22 who will be heading to the University of Chicago next fall on a full-ride scholarship she earned through the QuestBridge National College Match.

This month, she plans to summit the 19,347-foot Cotopaxi Volcano in the Andes Mountains of Ecuador.

Writing two to three letters a month, the students participating offer a connection point to people experiencing the isolation of detention. The letters offer hope to immigrants who spend much of their time alone and away from their families. This program has created an opportunity for students to wrestle with the challenge of writing a first letter introducing themselves to someone they don’t know. It also allows them to spend time emotionally connecting with people from all over the world as well as the United States. Writing letters and just being WITH someone at such a difficult time in their lives is what it truly means to be a Man or Woman WITH and for Others.\nRead More\nRJ AND THE (VIRTUAL) UN COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN\n4/9/2021\nThe UN Commission on the Status of Women is the principal global intergovernmental body exclusively dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women.

Therefore, we offer Masses regularly at the school throughout the school year. \n\nWe remain steadfast in our commitment to offering this pinnacle of our faith as frequently as we can. \n\nAll-School Masses\nThe entire school community comes together four times a year for all-school liturgies.\n\nClass Masses\nStudents also attend divisional and class Masses several times each semester.\n\nMass on Retreat\nThe Eucharist is also celebrated in the context of each of the class-level retreats.\n\nDaily Mass\nAll members of the community are welcome to attend a lunchtime Mass offered on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays (with the exception of First Fridays - see below) in the St. John Francis Regis Chapel in the boys building and on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the Blessed Rupert Mayer Chapel in the girls building. \n\nFirst Friday Mass\nA dedication to the Sacred Heart, students, parents, guardians, employees, alumni and friends of Regis Jesuit are invited to join us for a monthly Mass at 7:30 am on the first Friday of the month during the school year in the Blessed Rupert Mayer Chapel. First Friday in November is offered as a special Remembrance Mass for those who have gone before us in faith.

The Board of Trustees, RJ administration and staff collaborate to implement proven “best practices” in school safety that help ensure the physical and psychological safety of our students and staff.\n\n\nWe recognize that the school’s culture is a key aspect to providing a safe environment—helping members of the school community feel connected to each other so they can work together to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for all. We believe that all staff, students and parents play critical roles creating community so together, we can meet and exceed established safety standards.\n\n\nOur focus in these areas is the reason why our safety plan includes a purposeful connection between the physical and the psychological health and safety of our students.\nLIST OF 7 ITEMS.\nVisitors to Campus\nStandard Response Protocol (SRP)\nPartnerships with Law Enforcement and Safety Resources\nSchool Safety Teams\nEmployee Training\nSafety Communications and Alerts\nSafeguards Protecting Students from Inappropriate Interactions\nDress Code\nThe context for our dress code stems from our mission and philosophy of education. Regis Jesuit High School seeks to maintain an atmosphere that is conducive to the highest quality of learning and animates the mission of our school. \nTo maintain structures for students which will help their growth in maturity, personal responsibility and self-discipline, Regis Jesuit has instituted a dress code policy aimed at limiting distractions from learning and engagement in our community, invites equity between students in the ways they present themselves and provides students with clear expectations about forms of dress. The school believes that appropriate dress and appearance reflect good motivation, sensitivity to others and respect for oneself and for the school community.\nVIEW THE STUDENT DRESS CODE\nBOB ZARLENGO ’68\n After I graduated, I began to realize more and more how much ‘out of the classroom knowledge’ I left [Regis Jesuit] with. The Jesuit education model taught me how to think both inside and outside the box. It taught me how to solve problems, how to interact with people in an intelligent matter and how to think on my feet.

Each student is paired with a school counselor with whom they build a relationship with over their four years at Regis Jesuit. The counselors provide students academic, career and personal/social counseling in a variety of settings. Throughout a student's high school career, but especially during their junior and senior years, school counselors work in tandem with the College Counseling team to ensure each student is ready for the next step in their journey.  They achieve this by helping students learn to think critically, advocate for themselves and take responsibility for their actions and decisions. \nAn attitude of openness, acceptance, honesty and compassion is the key to a good relationship between counselor and student.\nThe Learning Services Program at Regis Jesuit High School is designed to maintain the dignity and uniqueness of individuals with diagnosed learning differences.\nLIST OF 1 ITEMS.\nHSPT Extended Time Accommodations\nLearning Services Program\nPrograms in each division support students with specific learning differences, so they may work toward their academic potential. These diagnosed learning differences include reading disorders, math disorders, disorders of written expression, ADHD, autism spectrum disorders and physical disabilities. Psychological disabilities, such as anxiety or depression, are addressed through the Counseling Office and sometimes through private counseling. Anxiety toward testing, while impactful, is not accommodated through the Learning Services Office. Students who are intrinsically motivated and committed to improving organizational, self-advocacy and communication skills are the most likely to be successful in the program. We provide limited classroom accommodations which include extra time on quizzes and exams, help with notetaking and preferential seating.\n\nIn order for students to access official accommodations, they must provide a comprehensive psychoeducational assessment conducted by a licensed psychologist within the last three years and commit to being re-evaluated when the current evaluations expire. This evaluation must include a statement of the specific learning difference and how it affects the student. A disability code as specified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV or V) is preferred. The evaluation should also include complete results from comprehensive cognitive testing, achievement testing, and other measures on which the diagnosis is based as well as recommended school accommodations for the student. For further information regarding the Learning Services Program, please contact the coordinator in the appropriate division.\nLIST OF 1 MEMBERS.\nChristine Oliver \nDirector of Learning Services\n(303) 269-8046\nOur Libraries\nEach division has its own library that is maintained as a single-gender learning environment housing a computer lab/classroom, spaces for group projects and study and study carrels and reading areas for individual work. The staff is happy to assist with research projects using the resources available at Regis Jesuit or via other libraries or online resources. The libraries also provide print and tech support to students and faculty and are the keepers of the school's archive.\nMission of the RJHS Libraries\n\nTo serve our community in whatever capacity is needed, ex. makerspaces for STEAM disciplines, community spaces for collaborative and independent learning, provide access to academic resources, prioritize diversity, teach research strategies, etc.\nTo foster critical thinking skills and teach students how to become lifelong learners.\nTo create discerning information consumers and responsible citizens in this digital age.\nTo celebrate intellectual freedom and nurture a love for reading!\nTo encourage empathy with all peoples by providing access to reading materials that represent diverse perspectives.\nLIST OF 4 ITEMS.\nStephen A Finn (Boys) Library Hours\nGirls Library Hours\nSchool Archives\nContact the Library\nNurse's Offices\nTo ensure the health and safety of our students, each division has its own Nurse's Office staffed on school days by a registered nurse who is supported by parent volunteers with medical experience or backgrounds. The Nurse's Offices provide care for sick students, support those with on-going medical conditions such as severe allergies, epilepsy or diabetes and partner with our coaches and athletic trainers to care for students recovering from athletic injuries including concussions.\nFood Service Program\nRegis Jesuit partners with Flik Independent School Dining (FISD) to provide our school food service program. They manage the operations of both cafeterias and the Steele Center Café, as well as provides catering services for school events. The food offered accommodates those who follow restricted diets, e.g. vegetarian or gluten-free, and Flik will work with parents to help create plans for students with food sensitivities or allergies.\n\nAligning with Regis Jesuit's overall commitment to environmental sustainability and community health and wellness, Flik has a strong commitment to sustainability, healthy cooking from scratch and using locally-sourced ingredients whenever possible to bring the highest quality food to our program. ",

Through the summer swim team in Castle Pines, they knew Teddy ’15 and John ’17 Koerner, who went on to graduate from Pomona College and Columbia University respectively. And they knew about Jackson Fox ’13, another swimmer, who works as a consultant at Deloitte, after graduating from Notre Dame. \n\nFinancially, Regis Jesuit was an ambitious choice for the Tierneys, but thanks to financial aid, their boys were able to dive right in. As student-athletes dedicated to serving others, they’ve made quite the splash.\n“My parents met and saw some really high-achieving kids, so they had a great impression from the get-go,” said Ryan, now a second-year student at Harvard where he swims with the varsity team and is part of the Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corp (NROTC). “They value education above all else, and, as a Catholic family, we knew about the benefits of a Jesuit education. At Regis Jesuit, I learned to tackle issues from a lot of different angles. I learned to think critically.” He also continued his commitment to service, learned to improvise on the trumpet with the RJ Advanced Jazz Ensemble and graduated as valedictorian of the Boys Division in 2020. His valedictory speech, The Final Lesson, was defined in part by the impact of COVID on the senior class.\n\n“Self-sacrifice is the highest form of the human condition,” he shared. “We use it to lift others up… Right now, more than 80,000 people have died across the United States in the past three months from coronavirus. While much of this may be out of our control, through the sacrifice of our ‘senior sunset’ (which pales in comparison to the immense self-sacrifice of the healthcare workers in this country), we have been empowered to show love for our fellow humans and to prevent future casualties, even though we may never be aware of their existence.”\n\nRyan’s brother Matthew is now a senior at Regis Jesuit. He also considers service to be one of the most impactful parts of his high school experience, along with playing trombone in the jazz ensemble and being a member of the Diversity Action Group (DAG).\n\n“It was not only the things we did [in DAG], but I also made most of my closest friends there,” he says. Through his association with DAG, Matthew and 17 other RJ students and four adults attended the 65th annual meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of Women CSW65 in March of 2021. The theme was women's full and effective participation and decision-making in public life, as well as the elimination of violence, for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. \n\nMatthew says, “We listened to presentations from adult activists and commission leaders from all over the world. I took away that women’s rights mean different things in different places. Of course, I’m a white guy, but hopefully, our experience there, and our new awareness, encourages more people like me—especially at Regis Jesuit—to learn more and do more to make our school a more diverse and understanding place.” Matthew’s blog about the experience can be found online here.  \n\nThe Tierney boys’ father Patrick says, “Regis developed our sons morally, mentally and physically. As their understanding of their academic subjects matured, so did their understanding of God.”\n\nTheir mother Sarah agrees, sharing that she is “profoundly grateful” for the generous financial aid that made it possible for her family to experience the community and education that uniquely defines the school. “Thanks to the benevolence of the Regis community, our sons have benefited from an outstanding education and have developed lifelong friendships.”\nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

The headline read: “In the startup world, listening is key.”\n\n\nIt turns out that listening not only been the key to Armistead’s success in businesses, it also played an important part in his formation at Regis Jesuit, and at Stanford thereafter.  \n“You don’t necessarily associate listening with high school students, but that’s when the Jesuit values really sank in for me,” he said. “Take the often-quoted creed Men and Women with and for Others. You can’t be for someone or something unless you understand their ambitions, their struggles, how they think and where they would like to go. To do that, you have to listen.” \n \nArmistead now lives in Los Altos, California, and Respond Software has been purchased by FireEye Inc. where Mike continues in an executive role. Across more than a thousand miles, he has heard the call of Inspire & Ignite 2025, Regis Jesuit’s vision for access, innovation and excellence—especially the goal of removing real and perceived barriers to entry and retention for students and families who desire to attend. He has responded wholeheartedly, with a significant financial aid gift in the name of the Armistead Family Endowed Scholarship. \n \n“If someone can’t go because of need, it’s a tragedy,” said Armistead, who worked during high school, including as a janitor, while playing football, basketball and running track. He also dabbled in speech and debate, worked backstage in the theatre program and was elected vice president of student government. He received significant financial aid to attend Stanford, where he majored in engineering and continued to work at various jobs to help pay for school expenses.  \n \nThe gift from Armistead and his wife Kathy will ensure that a student with financial need can experience what Mike says benefitted him the most: “the hard work and challenges required to excel at many things, along with the cross-group friendships and involvement in activities that cut across traditional stereotypes and cliques.”   \n \nHe said: “I gained a lot of confidence in those days, primarily by stretching beyond being ‘just an athlete’ or ‘just a good student.’ That’s what I’d like to enable in someone else.” \n \nThe Armistead family’s ties to Jesuit education—and to Regis Jesuit—remain strong. Mike’s three sons attended the all-male Bellarmine College Preparatory school in San Jose. His brother, Mark ’80 runs Regis Jesuit’s annual golf tournament, The Rudy Cup, which supports the Rudy Brada Scholarship for Financial Aid. Between Mark and their brother Matthew ’86, they count three more Raider alums: Joanna ’09, Greg ’06 and Colin ’19. Caroline will graduate in 2022.  \n \n“I grew up neither wealthy or poor and went to Catholic school. I saw my parents putting money in the collection plate every week; and I learned early on that giving back is incredibly important. Over the years, I’ve been the recipient of someone else’s generosity, and I include my Catholic educators as part of that.” \n \nArmistead knows that his family’s gift to Regis Jesuit will make a real difference. “When I look at the places I can support, I choose the ones that are most deserving and also will be the most appreciative. For me, Regis Jesuit certainly fits that criteria.” \nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

Four hours from Ethiopia to Qatar, 13 more to New York, and finally, another four hours to Denver. Back then, Wolde boarded three flights before she reached her destination. So, it’s no surprise she had the resilience to persist until she finally found her home at Regis Jesuit—her third high school in as many years.\nNow, as Wolde takes her RJ diploma to Washington University in St. Louis on a full scholarship, she looks back with gratitude for the opportunities she received at Regis Jesuit, including financial aid from donors who believed she was a worthy investment. She’s also indebted to Alivian Jorgensen, Assistant Director of Admissions, who helped her twice navigate the application process and ultimately become a straight-A student with a passion for math and for service. \n\n\n“I love helping other people,” said Wolde, who emigrated to Denver with her mother, father and three siblings. “Being kind doesn’t cost any pennies.” Her younger sister, Christina '24, is also a Regis Jesuit student thanks to financial aid. \n\n\nNot long after the Wolde family settled in Aurora, Lidya’s father became extremely ill with Hepatitis B. This meant relocating to Denver, where health care would be more accessible but also meant Lidya would have to leave the Lotus School for Excellence, a small charter school serving a global population. At Lotus, she excelled in honors classes, but still, she was declined the first time she applied to Regis Jesuit. The official deadline had passed, and the class was already fully enrolled.\n\n\n“But Ms. Jorgensen encouraged me to keep in touch and to try again the following year,” said Wolde. So as soon as she had her first-semester sophomore transcript from Denver East, she sent it in. It showed all As in Algebra II Honors, Honors Chemistry, AP World History and English II Honors. She also was taking Spanish III and a computer class.\n\n\nJorgensen recalls: “Lidya’s self-advocacy and maturity stood out in her first phone call to the Admissions Office. Over the course of several conversations, it was obvious Lidya was special and will be a force of good in our world. She was disappointed with the first decision, but she embraced it with grace and grit. She is just the perfect combination of those two words. Add in brilliance and you have quite the full package.” \n\n\nWolde was thrilled to be accepted and become among the one in three students to receive financial aid. She said, “The mission is what drew me to Regis. I knew about the school from a neighbor who also was Ethiopian and had a son who had graduated. Plus, I was committed to doing service.”\n\n\nA critical part of Inspire & Ignite 2025, Regis Jesuit’s Strategic Plan for Access, Innovation and Excellence, is increasing the number of students who receive aid and expanding the diversity of the student body.\n\n\nWolde’s first experience was the Kairos Retreat in September. “I can’t say exactly what we did there, but I experienced for the first time what it’s like to learn to love yourself and other people. I don’t usually talk about myself deeply, and I think it was new to others as well. It was lovely to get to know the girls.” \n\n\nLater, encouraged by her new friends, she joined Key Club, Girls Up and the Diversity Action Group (DAG), where she focused on service, empowering girls and issues of race that are “really important in the world and at Regis.” She spent her two-week junior Service Project at Samaritan House in Denver, where she served meals, accepted donations, did laundry, helped in the office and got to know residents by talking to them whenever she could. Senior year has gone quickly, and she’s now looking ahead to college, where she’ll major in math and computer science.\n\nWhen Wolde looks back on her time at Regis Jesuit, she says she found a loving community where, even as a transfer student, she didn’t have to struggle to make friends. “My biggest struggle was after my dad got sick, but I’ve been lucky to make friends easily and do well in school. Kindness is the way to win the world. It’s what I’m living for.”\nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

A prime example is Fr. Edward Maguire, SJ, who served as Dean of Discipline between 1971-73. Any student who attended at the time can’t help but remember him.\n\"Fr. Maguire was tough,” recalls Dan Murray ’74, who has helped manage the Maguire-Gockel Scholarship fund since its inception more than 40 years ago. “Every day, he’d be standing at the main entrance to the school, with his beefy arms around his Bible. And if he found anything awry—like a shirt untucked or maybe you were a bit tardy—he’d send you straight to JUG. Back then, I was a frequent miler.”\n\nMurray still recalls the time he tried to skip his JUG assignment in favor of attending football practice. “Fr. Maguire said, ‘I want you to memorize these 20 lines of scripture.’ I tried and tried. But I could only get to three or four. Finally, I said, ‘I want to call my mom and transfer.’”\n\nThat was a pivotal moment for Murray, whose father had died when he was just 11 years old. One of seven children, his mother sent him “kicking and screaming to Regis for the male influence,” though Murray strongly preferred to be in school with girls. Financial aid made attendance possible.\n“It turns out Fr. Maguire also had lost his dad at an early age,” said Murray. “He took an hour out of his busy day to talk to me about growing up without a father. He asked me what kind of home life I had, and we bonded right then and there. For the rest of the year, I felt his kindness.”\n\nThe following summer, Fr. Maguire died unexpectedly while swimming and Murray vowed to honor his life by starting a scholarship fund in Maguire’s name. That year, a few of Murray’s friends made small donations. and Br. Joe Gockel, SJ, who worked in the library and as a baker in the school cafeteria, became a stalwart supporter. Br. Joe was a memorable though less imposing presence on campus, encouraging and supporting students through their high school years. When he died in March 2003, his name was added to the fund.\n\n\"Br. Joe had a heart of gold,” Murray recalled. “He was happy-go-lucky; and every time you saw him, he was smiling. He would hit me up for $20 every year, and by the time I was about 28 years old, out of college and earning a living, he asked me to be a trustee of the fund.” \n\nToday, the Father Edward Maguire, SJ and Brother Joseph Gockel, SJ Perpetual Memorial Scholarship Fund, the official name, is the oldest and most prestigious in the school’s history, having helped more than 100 students—boys and girls—afford the cost of attendance. Now, as the chair of the fund, Murray contributes generously to it and to other strategic initiatives. He and his wife Denise have sent three of their four sons to Regis Jesuit, and in 2005 they were honored with St. John Francis Regis Outstanding Service Award for their volunteer engagement with the school.\n\nEvery spring, Murray and the others on the Maguire-Gockel Scholarship committee review the bios of a dozen or so rising sophomores to decide who will receive the scholarship for their next three years at Regis Jesuit. “We look for people who are economically distressed and have at least a 3.0 grade point average, though most are 3.5,” he said. “And they’re either involved in the Regis Christian Life Community (RCLC), or they’re giving back through their churches.” Then, the donors and recipients meet at a luncheon.\n\n“I tell them about Fr. Maguire, and we talk about their dreams and aspirations. There’s a lot of pride among the kids who qualify for the scholarship. They know how lucky they are to be recognized in this way, and they hold their heads high. Years later, as a way of keeping Fr. Maguire’s care and concern alive, most of them give back to the fund.” \nBack\n  \n2012 Maguire-Gockel Scholarship Lunch\n2012 Maguire-Gockel Scholarship Lunch\nback\nnext",

She has been teaching for 30 years: in schools both single-gender and co-educational, public and private, and religious and secular. She’s also the parent to Ian ’15 and Sadie ’18.\n\n\n“A boy playing the violin and a girl playing a violin—there’s nothing different about how they approach the music, from a technical or mechanical perspective,” said Wuertz. “That’s why, in 2014, the boys’ and girls’ orchestras were combined, as was the concert band program. These types of ensembles are stronger with the students together.”\n\n\nBut, Wuertz acknowledged, there often are key differences in the classroom, especially around competition and collaboration. “If I have a short little contest, the boys will bite,” she said. “They’ll play. And that will increase their engagement. In an all-girls class, I’d rather use collaboration to increase buy-in.” \n\n\nAt Regis Jesuit, Wuertz taught just boys until fall 2014, when the Steele Center opened and became the first “declared shared space” on campus. Now, boys and girls socialize together on the green, in the café and in performing arts spaces—though most classes are held separately.\n\n\nWith the future Science & Innovation Center (SIC), Wuertz and her counterpart in the Girls Division, Tim Bauer ’88, along with many teachers across both divisions are keen to improve even further on the blend of separate and combined activities that she calls “the best of both worlds.”\n \n“We need large, flexible spaces, where we can move tables and chairs around and facilitate dialogue,” she said. “For example, in a theology or history class, boys and girls often are studying the same texts, only separately. We want everyone to learn from each other, so it will be great to be able to bring them together sometimes, to explore their different perspectives and interactions with the material.”\n\n\nDustin Dvorak, chair of Regis Jesuit’s unified science department serving both boys and girls, says the key to breaking down stereotypes is the one-on-one relationships he has with his students. “And yet, regardless of gender, they all need access to inspiration.”\n\n\nThe new SIC will improve STEM facilities for all students—but especially the girls. “The curiosity students develop in high school is a big driver for continuing on,” said Dvorak. “So, if our girls miss out on the full experience to see concepts in action—through physical demonstrations, chemical reactions, live experiments—it’s possible they may lose interest.” Currently, nine sections of science classes for girls (vs. two for boys) are taught in non-science classrooms.\n\n\nThe SIC will have pods of specialized science classrooms. For example, the four for chemistry will have fume hoods, chemical storage space, and access to gas, sinks and safety equipment. Biology rooms will have grow lights, places for tanks, and refrigerators to store what students will be dissecting. For robotics and engineering classes and co-curricular activities, there will be a new fabrication space with a woodshop, metal shop, jewelry-making tools, a 3-D printer and powerful computers with the software needed to design and build absolutely anything.\n\n\n“Dedicated facilities and equipment will really expand our repertoire of what we can do,” Dvorak said. “And because every science class for boys and girls will be taught in the building, every freshman, sophomore and junior student will be there every other day at a minimum.”\n\n\nHaving equitable space for boys and girls will make a big difference in breaking down stereotypes, which is important to Dvorak and Wuertz, and to all students and teachers at Regis Jesuit. \n\n\nWuertz said: “In our unique model at RJ, we have the opportunity and the responsibility to capitalize on the benefits of single-gender education, as well as to bring the students together for co-educational experiences with intentionality and purpose. Caring for and loving our students starts with setting up a classroom environment where all students can feel safe and included.”\nBack\nback\nnext",

In search of greater challenge, she got herself accepted into the engineering program. Between her junior and senior undergraduate years, she landed a yearlong co-op at a brewery, then found her way to law school at CU Boulder, where she’s now in her second year. She plans to specialize in intellectual property law.\n“One of the things I got from Regis is the strong desire to work with and for others,” she said. “Engineering provides an opportunity for that but it’s a little more indirect, so I started looking at ways I could use all the things I love about engineering—the problem solving, the analytical thinking—in a more direct, interpersonal way. The law is the perfect combination.” \n\nNow, with a mentoring program she helped start at Regis Jesuit, Canino is helping girls plot their future careers. “I wished I had a similar opportunity, especially as a first-generation student. I had no idea what I wanted to study in college, or what career would suit me. I would have benefited if I had college-age women to ask.” Some of her mentees keep in touch for college advice. One even asked Canino to write a recommendation. \n\nCanino’s first four-part mentoring program focused on engineering. It was held in person on campus before the pandemic forced everything online. The sessions filled up immediately, with girls who came to learn about engineering fields and Canino’s college experiences. In a speed-mentoring event, they met briefly with professionals in the field. Recently, Canino and Lauren (Troksa) Knapp ‘14, who is now a practicing lawyer, transitioned the program online and focused on what to expect from law school and beyond. Knapp is the sister of Blake Troksa ’14, whom Canino married in 2019. \n\nMentoring came naturally to Canino. “I just kinda knew what to do,” she said. “I talk to them as friends. I tell them I’m a firm believer in keeping as many doors open as possible; and opening as many as you can for yourself. That principle, which I learned at Regis Jesuit, has shaped my character and led to monumental decisions regarding my career and my family life. The more opportunities you have, the better. Because you don’t necessarily have to decide what to do right away.” \n\nAt Regis Jesuit, Canino played basketball and excelled in academics, but her heart was in service. She served as a leader for Freshman Retreat and Kairos and earned the Dorothy Day Service Award her senior year. In April 2020, moved by the impacts of COVID-19, she started HumanKind Network from her home. Nearly 400 volunteers now provide free virtual tutoring to school kids, free contactless grocery delivery and elderly isolation support.  \n\nWhen Canino talks to her mentees—especially the seniors who may be rushing to the finish line—she has a powerful message that comes from the heart. “You’re getting ready to end a very important chapter of your life and to start a new and exciting one, but you’re the author of your own story. You can either rush through that chapter to get to the next one, or you can take your time and encompass a more meaningful story. Because when you look back, you’re going to want to remember all the wonderful things that came with senior year.” \n\nClearly, Canino’s own story will be exciting to follow!\nBack\nback\nnext",

She has a concrete plan; she has allies; and she has the wisdom that only can come from personal experience. \n \nWith the participation and support of fellow students and school administration, Leaffer is helping create an environment where more girls and boys at Regis Jesuit are willing to seek mental health support when they need it.\n“Mental health is a problem and I hate that it’s so stigmatized,” Leaffer said. “During my sophomore year, the pandemic hit, which made things worse all across the country. It really tore my heart apart, because, even before, a lot of kids didn’t feel like they could share their problems.” \n \nLeaffer is as fascinated with the human brain and behavior as she is with horses. When not reading or studying for Mr. Walsweer’s psychology classes or exploring the subject on her own time, she spends some 25 hours a week riding and training as a show jumper. To raise money for mental health projects at Regis Jesuit and elsewhere, she works at a barn, mucking stalls and feeding and grooming horses, including two of her own. She travels to events around the country and hopes to compete in college and one day, make it to the Fédération Équestre Internationale Jumping World Cup.  \n \nLeaffer grew up in an interfaith home. Her father is Jewish and her mother Catholic, whom she said, “always trusted me to believe in whatever I chose.” She was attracted to Regis Jesuit for its Catholic values and what she calls the “demeanor” of the school. “I love religion and history, so the curriculum looked perfect.” She had heard that Jesuit education encompassed the whole person, so she believed she wouldn’t have to sacrifice her riding as long as she got her schoolwork done. She also hoped she could continue to advocate for more transparency around mental health.\n \nNow in her junior year, Leaffer is working closely with Dana Bauer, Assistant Principal of Student Support, to bring more student voices into the conversation about mental health issues. The timing has been perfect, because, under Bauer, whose administrative role is new this school year, the school has begun integrating all health and counseling services across campus to provide a more holistic approach. Bauer had been a school counselor at Regis Jesuit for many years.\n\n\nBauer now oversees 20 people in five departments, including Learning Services, School Counseling and College Counseling. “Students cannot be fully successful in academics if their mental health is not the number one priority,” she said. “We are a unique environment, where cura personalis—the care and concern of the whole person—permeates everything we do. Katherine has helped us see how important it is to hear from the students exactly what it is they need and how they want to proceed at Regis Jesuit.” \n \nTogether, Bauer and Leaffer have organized a student advisory committee, and they are creating an open forum for students to share their stories and be heard by the administration. At the first meeting, students spoke openly about what services they need, what the school is doing well and what blind spots exist. After reviewing a list of the many services and programs the school could add, Leaffer’s family—and Katherine herself—provided seed funding to ensure that Regis Jesuit’s one part-time school therapist could expand her hours to full-time. The school also is hiring a second full-time therapist, and recently was awarded a grant by the University of Colorado to implement Botvin LifeSkills Training for incoming high school students to help them build skills to navigate the challenges they face. \n \nAdditional fundraising efforts will make more financial and community supports available for students and integrate more student-led programming into the school day. Programs such as individual counseling, therapy options and counseling groups will continue, but more resources will be added as additional student needs are identified. \n  \n“Everyone’s heart is in this,” said Bauer, who now has a long list of initiatives that will help the Raider community. “Gaining support shouldn’t be a hard sell. But we can’t afford to wait. Thanks to Katherine, we’ve got a lot of students who are as passionate as she is.”   \nBack\nback\nnext",

I learned if something is hard, staying with it and trying new approaches is better than taking a break and then going back to doing the same thing over and over.”\nReyes was one of a growing number of female students who participate annually in Regis Jesuit’s Robotics Club. She discovered her interest in STEM when she attended the Porter-Billups Leadership Academy at Regis University, which provides academic and leadership training to at-risk inner-city students in the Denver area. This fall, she will begin college at Regis U as an aspiring computer science and engineering major. “Knowing they follow the same Jesuit teaching and morals I had for the past four years made me feel safe,” she says. \n\nYet Reyes also is perfectly comfortable with risk. At the club fair held during her first weeks at Regis Jesuit, she introduced herself to members of the Robotics Club. “They said I could build on what I’d done, and they encouraged me to challenge myself even more.” By sophomore year, Reyes was one of a handful leaders of the co-ed club, and in her junior year, became the captain. The next year, she became a senior mentor. “Single-ed classes provided a space where we could be ourselves,” she said. “Then, when the boys and girls came together to collaborate and build things together, we could appreciate each other for what we brought to the team.” She credited the club’s mentors—who came from Lockheed Martin, Boeing, the Colorado School of Mines and elsewhere—for making sure everyone had equal chance to participate.\n\nKelly Knechtel, Assistant Director for the Women in Science, Engineering and Mathematics Program at the Colorado School of Mines, believes investments in the community, such as the Science & Innovation Center, will give female students access to careers they may not have considered. As adviser to the public university’s 700-member Society of Women Engineers, she’s passionate about reducing barriers for women in STEM. “As we engage the next generation of engineers and scientists, educators need to ensure we are providing women with learning experiences, mentors and affinity groups that broaden their perspectives, inspire their confidence and expand perceptions of their own potential in STEM fields.”\n\nAs both female and male students express curiosity and creativity across many disciplines, Regis Jesuit is moving boldly forward with Inspire & Ignite 2025, its strategic plan for access, innovation and excellence. The addition of the 65,000-square-foot future Science & Innovation Center (SIC) will fill many needs: for new technology and tools, and for more advanced academic offerings in STEM, art and architecture, journalism and other creative fields. It also will likely attract top talent to Regis Jesuit—people such as George Mitsuoka, the newly hired Director of the Innovation Center within the SIC. A graduate of MIT, Mitsuoka has had a varied career as a software engineer, technical writer and volunteer mentor to high school students in Denver for nearly 20 years. He also has three daughters, including Ariana ’20, who attends Wellesley College, and Sophia ’23. \n\nMitsuoka’s vision is bold. “We hope to inspire students with ambitious hands-on projects, motivating and teaching them new skills, providing them with opportunities to build confidence and instilling within them a sense of personal responsibility to take on the world’s challenges.” Working not only with the traditional STEM departments, including science and mathematics, he hopes every department will see the Innovation Center as a resource they will use to improve the student experience at Regis Jesuit High School. “I know our fine arts teachers are already excited about the creative possibilities the Innovation Center will enable. I’ve even begun discussions with our Theology Department about how future service projects can be enhanced by projects such as low-cost water purification for underserved communities.”\n\n“My hope is that students will eventually drive much of what happens within the Innovation Center. We’re eager to give them the skills and tools they need to follow their curiosity and are excited to see where they take it,” he said. “There’s no shortage of problems that need to be solved, and, as all of our students, especially our girls, become better trained and educated, they’ll gain the confidence to solve those problems.  They will become better prepared for college and careers where they can continue to learn and grow as creative, brave and entrepreneurial leaders.” \n\nAs the campus’s new “front door” the SIC will signal Regis Jesuit’s commitment to the future for industry visitors, prospective families and alumni mentors who, as part of RJ Connect, are returning to campus in greater numbers than ever before.\n\nSofia Reyes learned all this firsthand, and her experiences are helping inform future plans for the Innovation Center. “Having mentors and the space to explore new fields—like agriculture or biomedical engineering—will encourage more people, especially girls, to choose STEM fields. And I’ll be happy to come back and help however I can.” \nBack\nback\nnext",

As faculty adviser to the student-run RJ Media program, he is cultivating critical thinkers and active listeners, who express their humanity and compassion through telling stories.  \n \nHe said, “Journalism is the perfect way to teach students about ‘others’—and also to inspire them to fight for more justice and solidarity.”\nDawkins led the 2019 service immersion trip to Tijuana, Mexico, where 10 students, gathered source material for their social documentary Crossing Borders. The film, now being screened for the public, is sparking deep conversations about migration. Dawkins’ next yearlong generative journalism course will explore homelessness in Denver. \n \n“Generative journalism allows us to be hyper-focused on a theme or issue that is grounded in our Jesuit mission, our Catholic social teaching and our faith,” Dawkins said. “Then, all the work we do, all the stories we find and tell, can be directed at amplifying the message and uplifting voices in the community.” \n \nAfter many years of steady growth, journalism classes and extracurricular media activities now engage 600-700 students per year, from the Concordia yearbook and Elevate magazine, to the weekly RJTV broadcast news show and live broadcasts of Raider sports and events. As RJ Media racks up awards from the Colorado Student Media Association, Journalism Education Association and National Scholastic Press Association, it needs more creative and flexible space.  \n \nErika Rasmussen ’16, who took journalism classes and freelanced a few stories while at Regis Jesuit, is now on a yearlong journalism fellowship in New York, at America Media, a Jesuit media ministry that produces America magazine and other properties. She recalls RJ Media’s move to the Steele Center in 2014. “Having a dedicated space that belonged to all students made all the difference,” she said. “Everyone felt welcome, and we were able to learn in community in a completely new way.” \n \nRJ Media’s next move to the future Science & Innovation Center will enable the program to have even wider impact on campus and beyond—by orders of magnitude. With three video and audio editing rooms, a circular stage, an LED screen and plenty of space for collaboration and team-teaching, the new interdisciplinary building will expand and enhance the teaching of all aspects of professional filmmaking and journalism.  \n \nRasmussen, who graduated from Santa Clara University in 2020 with majors in English and sociology and minors in Spanish and creative writing, is exploring what Joe Hoover, SJ, the poetry editor at America, described to her as: “the many rooms in my father’s house of journalism,” a reference to John 14:2. With mentorship from Hoover and others, she is learning about audio and video production and social media, writing stories on assignment and pitching ideas of her own. Her subjects have been relevant and complex, ranging from coronavirus vaccine ethics and how Jesuit universities tackle implicit bias, to the death penalty and the Netflix adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's 1938 novel Rebecca. \n \nWhatever the future holds, Rasmussen knows she wants to live her life “in a way that brings others into love and a sense of belonging and belovedness.” And that goal squares perfectly with what she learned at Regis Jesuit, and from Dawkins and RJ Media. \n \n“I’ve known since I was five years old that I want to be a writer,” she said. “I’m supposed to tell stories and to write them. I’m realizing now that stories are life, and stories are life giving. I’m being affirmed that my desire to do this is how I can love others—and we can love one another.”\nBack\nback\nnext",

And they’re tough. Lexi Segura ’24, who as a freshman was named 2021 Female Wrestler of the Year for the Continental League, is case in point. But from her perspective, wrestling isn’t only about being tough. \n\n“Wrestling teaches temperance,” said Segura, who has competed on the mat since she was five years old. “You might feel rage or want to cry but you don’t. It makes you a stronger person and a harder worker. It teaches discipline and builds confidence. It isn’t about winning and losing. It’s about winning and learning.\"\nSegura followed her brother Antonio Segura ’21 into the sport and to Regis Jesuit, where their father Gary serves as an assistant wrestling coach. Antonio is a three-time state champion and earned Wrestler of the Year distinction in both 2020 and 2021. Both brother and sister received 2021–2021 All-State awards. Lexi aspires to make it to the Pan American Wrestling Championships in the next couple of years.  \n\nGirls Wrestling is new at Regis Jesuit. Last year, Lizet Ramos ’21 and a few friends bravely stepped forward and asked to start a wrestling club. The school created the physical space and resources for a full-fledged sport, and now it is sanctioned by the Colorado High School Activities Association. Segura has come to personify not only the sport, but also equity for girls. \n\n“Being the ‘wrestler girl’ at Regis is exciting,” she said. “I get to help start the program and see it grow so it hopefully lasts beyond my time here. That’s cool.” She likes to inspire other girls who might wonder if they should try wrestling, or anything else that’s new and unfamiliar. “I tell them it’s okay to be scared. As long as girls stick to their goals and put in the work, we can do everything boys can do.” Her favorite subjects are math and theology, and she hopes to study marine biology one day. \n\nBryan Zerr ’05 wrestled at Regis Jesuit all four years and now returns to “roll around on the mat with the team” as a volunteer. “I feel deeply rooted to the school because that’s where I became the man I am today. My desire is to stay connected and give back, whether with my time, treasure or talents. I hope I can inspire others to do the same.” \n\nZerr sees wrestling as “an intensely spiritual sport” and one that cultivates discipline, focus and self-confidence, which can be especially important for girls as they navigate society’s norms of confidence, beauty and femininity. He credits wrestling for his success as an entrepreneurial real estate broker, husband and father of a toddler-aged daughter. “Wrestling pulls out and galvanizes the character,” he said. “It allows us to reach our God-given potential in other areas of life. There’s interplay between individuality—it’s you on the mat all by yourself—and at the same time, the solidarity of the team creates meaningful and transformative bonds.” \n\nSegura agrees. “Wrestling helps me find connection between me and God,” she said. “Sometimes I’ll pray for guidance, or to keep the wrestlers safe. But not for a wish to win. God doesn’t work that way.”\nBack\nback\nnext",

He said, “Winning is a byproduct of creating an environment in which young men can thrive.”\nBoys Varsity Soccer has won the League Championship the last four years in a row. They ranked number one in the state last year, and they only gave up a single goal in their entire season—in the final seconds of regulation play during the first round of the playoffs.\n\n\nWolf prepares his players for what he believes is most important in life, regardless of their sport. “I tell them that soccer will end at some point. They might get cut early, or they might have a 12-year professional run like Roger Espinoza ’05. So, the question is, what are they taking from the game that will make them a better person. What matters most is their relationship with each other and with God.” \n\n\nEspinoza plays Major League Soccer with Sporting Kansas City. He has also represented his homeland of Honduras at two World Cups and the 2012 Summer Olympics and now helps raise money and awareness to improve the lives of Hondurans. Espinoza and Wolf still keep in touch, as is the case with many alumni players who found a strong sense of family on the team.\n\n\nThe recent success of Boys Soccer, according to Wolf, is due in large part to the dedication of his two assistant coaches, Derek Scarth and Tommy Gilhooley. “They genuinely love the kids, and they love the mission—which is a beautiful mission. Their presence has further empowered me to embrace it and love it and put it on display for everyone to see.” \n\n\nScarth and Gilhooley both were star players at Regis University and have what Wolf calls an “equal stake” in the success of the team. “We complement each other,” Wolf said. “Derek does strategy and tactics. Tommy encourages the kids to observe the other players. Each of us has a group of lads we connect with so if someone is struggling, we know who should talk to them.”\n\n\nLeadership is an important value for the players and coaches. Many of the players serve as retreat leaders and frequently take on other formal and informal leadership roles throughout the school. The team maintains a 3.6 grade point average and nearly all made the Academic All-State team. Wolf says they are “easy accepts to any institution, whether or not they play.” \n\n\nTransforming athletics into a conduit for mission and leadership—known as Bold Move Four—is an important part of Inspire & Ignite 2025, Regis Jesuit’s Strategic Vision for Access, Innovation and Excellence. According to Wolf, having side-by-side playing fields is the one improvement that will help the most. In fact, that project is on the horizon for use by nearly 750 students, or 40 percent of Regis Jesuit’s student-athletes, who play field sports. This includes Boys Soccer and Girls Soccer, as well as Lacrosse and Rugby for both boys and girls, Field Hockey and Football, where leadership and mentorship also matter. \n\n\n“The role of the older players is to set an example for the younger ones,” said Wolf, who oversees the Freshman, Junior Varsity and Varsity Boys teams encompassing more than 80 players from freshman through their senior years. “We’ve done a lot to elevate the leadership of our older boys, but there’s a huge disconnect because our teams are physically separated and have to play at separate times. Our goal is to use the sport of soccer as an opportunity to form our boys as players, teammates, men and, most importantly, to grow in our relationship with God. Our older boys, who have a solid faith life, demand that respect from their younger teammates. I’d love to see them spend more time together.” \nBack\nback\nnext",

But first, she had to convince her busy mother that the sport wouldn’t dominate the family’s schedule. Her two parents are doctors. She and her three siblings already were involved in many activities. And academics had to come first.\n“Open gym fell on a Saturday and lucky for me my mother was busy that day and my father agreed to take me,” said Belibi, who was a freshman on that auspicious September day. She now attends Stanford, where she plays basketball on a full scholarship. The Cardinal recently won the national NCAA championship for the first time in 29 years.\n \n“I didn’t yet know a layup from a free-throw, but I stood out because I was tall and could jump really high. So suddenly, I went from a student who did school and played tennis on the side, to someone who wanted to play basketball and could maybe even go to college for basketball. That day changed how I saw myself and how I saw achieving my goals.”\n \nBelibi practiced hard, and by sophomore year became the first female high school player in Colorado to dunk the ball during game play. Now, she’s the eighth woman ever to make that shot in the history of college basketball. Academics are also important. “I’d always been drawn to science and math,” she said, “but at Regis I found I liked everything: the humanities, history, all of my English classes and all of the teachers who taught me.” She said the structure of longer class blocks, combined with the rigor and high expectations, prepared her for Stanford—as a student, an athlete and leader.\n \nBelibi is modest about her success, and she easily shares the credit: with her teammates, her coaches, her family, her teachers and God.\n \n“Everything I’ve accomplished is because of His protection and His blessing,” she said. “God softened my parents’ hearts so I could play. And science will tell you it’s hard for women to dunk a basketball because of the shape of our hips, and how much muscle power is needed. I have big hands and long arms, but I’m only 6’1” and there’s no way I should be able to get myself that high. At the end of the day, it’s pretty miraculous that I can dunk.”\n \nBut Belibi isn’t letting one sensational shot define her. She’s majoring in human biology and plans to become a pediatrician like her mother, rather than turning pro. “Dunking is cool, there’s no doubt about it, but I’m still me. I’m a sister. I’m a teenager. I watch a lot of Netflix. I cook and bake. I wish I could read more. And I’m kind of funny. In fact, I think I’m hilarious, though my family might disagree.”\n \nFor now, Belibi is planning a few moves into the future. She’s taking courses in physiology, adolescent brain development and the art of pediatric diagnosis. She said, “I want to understand how humans become who they are, which starts with children. Kids are the ones who will fix the mistakes we make, so it will be important to empower them.”\n \nBelibi says her career in medicine will combine science and faith. “People assume you can only believe in God or in science, but the world shouldn’t put so much emphasis on either or. In science, first you see it and then you believe it. Faith is believing in something you can’t necessarily see. There are so many aspects of medicine that are science, but at the end of the day, I still believe in miracles.”\nBack\nback\nnext",

Mary McNicholas showed their children the importance of manners and creating a warm social environment for anyone who came to their door. The family built their Denver-based business on these values, forging deep connections with the people they employed and the people they partnered with, giving everyone the opportunity to create a better future for themselves.\nIt's no surprise that the McNicholas family marked Regis Jesuit as an institution that aligned with their values and was worthy of their investment. Kevin served as Chair of the Board of Trustees from 1992-98, shepherding the school through significant change with the move to the current campus in Aurora. Mary and Kevin sent their two sons, Sean ’92 and Brendan ’96, to attend the school. Kevin passed away in 2020, but not before he and Mary began a legacy of giving to Regis Jesuit—a legacy marked by a favorite spot for boys and girls at the heart of our campus today: McNicholas Green. \n\nToday, the McNicholas family tradition of people-forward business and philanthropy is thriving. Now Sean leads the family business, SSA Group, and gives back to Regis Jesuit so that more young men and women will have opportunities the shape themselves into caring, thoughtful leaders.\n\n“I want to create an environment where the school can have the biggest impact on its students. As a member of the Regis Jesuit community, my job is to leave things better than they were,” says Sean.\n\nSean and his wife, Audra, have given a transformative gift to Inspire & Ignite 2025, Regis Jesuit’s vision for access, innovation and excellence. They believe in the entrepreneurial spirit that Regis Jesuit instills in our students, guiding them to create and share opportunities with their communities. Inspired to continue the family legacy, they chose to give the name McNicholas Plaza to the new gathering space on the east side of the Science & Innovation Center. “We have been fortunate in our life, and our job now is to create opportunities for those who wouldn’t have them otherwise and let them carve their own path in life.”\n\nInspire & Ignite 2025 is creating these opportunities through its three priority funding initiatives: Access & Affordability, Academic Enhancements and Athletic Needs. Currently under construction and in the community phase of fundraising, the future Science & Innovation Center will be a hub for Regis Jesuit students, alumni and faculty to gather and collaborate in an interactive, hands-on space where they can form big ideas to solve real-world problems, informed by a conscious, compassionate mind. The building will also be a front door to Regis Jesuit and house our alumni and industry engagement center a space for alumni to network with one another and mentor current students. Sean is a strong proponent of our RJ Connect programming that partners alumni with students, saying “If you have the chance to impact one person, and they go on to solve a problem facing our world, I would bet that student comes from Regis Jesuit.”\n\nWith this new facility, increased financial aid resources and athletics upgrades, Regis Jesuit will serve boys and girls in a way that honors the McNicholas family values and their legacy of philanthropy.\n\nTogether, the McNicholas family and all the Inspire & Ignite 2025 current and future donors are working to fulfill the mission of Regis Jesuit: creating Men and Women with and for Others. It takes a community of supporters and believers to keep this mission moving forward. The McNicholases are truly a family with and for Others and proud to support Regis Jesuit as we move boldly forward. \n\nSean and his family are honored to support such a transformative organization, saying, “what we do has to serve a bigger purpose. That is the key part of the RJ community. I wouldn’t have come to that understanding without Regis Jesuit being a part of my life.”\nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

That’s why the couple has supported the vision for Inspire & Ignite 2025 and its future Science & Innovation Center with a transformative gift. In honor of their generosity, the school's new main entrance to campus will be named Hendricks Way.\n“For us, Catholic threads connect everywhere, over and over,” said Mike, who was raised in Denver as the second oldest of nine children, and to this day has a wide circle of Catholic friends and business associates, including many alumni of Regis Jesuit. Mike followed his older brother to Regis Jesuit, and nearly 35 years later, his son Mike, Jr. graduated in 2001 and he’s sure his granddaughters and grandsons will attend one day too.\n\n“The Jesuits know how to build community,” said Maureen, whose father attended Regis High School in New York City. Maureen met Mike while she was teaching at a parochial school in the Denver area and later, she became involved with RJ—working in the lunchroom and making homemade cookies. She also volunteered for various Catholic and social organizations.\n\n“Kairos taught our son to speak up and be a leader,” says Maureen, “and those values have stayed with him to this day.” She regrets that they couldn’t send their daughters to Regis Jesuit because the Girls Division didn’t yet exist.\n\nMike added: “Our daughters had community at their schools, and they’re also very good people, but they missed out on the kind of Catholic community our son got at Regis. We really appreciate the school’s Catholic-centered approach to the world, which is so necessary today.”\n\nMike’s commitment to Catholic education also is deeply personal. He attended St. Thomas Seminary for two years and worked in religious education for Catholic parishes in the Denver area. He taught Theology at Regis Jesuit for three years. Through lunchtime conversations with science teacher Bob Guptil, he rediscovered his love of earth science, which manifested first in Guptil's classroom during his senior year. In search of a deeper understanding of the natural world, Mike next earned master and doctorate degrees at the Colorado School of Mines. He became an oil and gas geologist and continues to work prospecting in the western states today.\n\n“We’ve been really fortunate, and it’s our pleasure to give back to the school,” says Mike. “Regis has done a lot for my family and me and continues to do a lot for people throughout the Denver area. I hope others will join me and Maureen in supporting educational experiences at Regis Jesuit where students can grow in their faith and their relationship with God.”\n\nMore than 20 years ago, Mike started the First Friday Choir at Regis Jesuit, to bring fathers and sons together for liturgy. Today, the monthly morning Mass, which celebrates the Jesuits' long-held dedication to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, draws parents, students, coaches and their teams, faculty, alumni and even nearby parishioners. And Mike still plays guitar with the choir.\n\nOf their support for the Science & Innovation Center, Mike says, “I encourage others to join in supporting the Science & Innovation Center. First of all, they need space that is dedicated to science and technology. Those are big needs of society and also needs of the school. The fact that the building will be centered between the boys and girls buildings will help the students feel like they are all part of the Regis community.\" Maureen adds: “I have total faith in the leadership of the school.

And they’re tough. Lexi Segura ’24, who as a freshman was named 2021 Female Wrestler of the Year for the Continental League, is case in point. But from her perspective, wrestling isn’t only about being tough. \n\n“Wrestling teaches temperance,” said Segura, who has competed on the mat since she was five years old. “You might feel rage or want to cry but you don’t. It makes you a stronger person and a harder worker. It teaches discipline and builds confidence. It isn’t about winning and losing. It’s about winning and learning.\"\nSegura followed her brother Antonio Segura ’21 into the sport and to Regis Jesuit, where their father Gary serves as an assistant wrestling coach. Antonio is a three-time state champion and earned Wrestler of the Year distinction in both 2020 and 2021. Both brother and sister received 2021–2021 All-State awards. Lexi aspires to make it to the Pan American Wrestling Championships in the next couple of years.  \n\nGirls Wrestling is new at Regis Jesuit. Last year, Lizet Ramos ’21 and a few friends bravely stepped forward and asked to start a wrestling club. The school created the physical space and resources for a full-fledged sport, and now it is sanctioned by the Colorado High School Activities Association. Segura has come to personify not only the sport, but also equity for girls. \n\n“Being the ‘wrestler girl’ at Regis is exciting,” she said. “I get to help start the program and see it grow so it hopefully lasts beyond my time here. That’s cool.” She likes to inspire other girls who might wonder if they should try wrestling, or anything else that’s new and unfamiliar. “I tell them it’s okay to be scared. As long as girls stick to their goals and put in the work, we can do everything boys can do.” Her favorite subjects are math and theology, and she hopes to study marine biology one day. \n\nBryan Zerr ’05 wrestled at Regis Jesuit all four years and now returns to “roll around on the mat with the team” as a volunteer. “I feel deeply rooted to the school because that’s where I became the man I am today. My desire is to stay connected and give back, whether with my time, treasure or talents. I hope I can inspire others to do the same.” \n\nZerr sees wrestling as “an intensely spiritual sport” and one that cultivates discipline, focus and self-confidence, which can be especially important for girls as they navigate society’s norms of confidence, beauty and femininity. He credits wrestling for his success as an entrepreneurial real estate broker, husband and father of a toddler-aged daughter. “Wrestling pulls out and galvanizes the character,” he said. “It allows us to reach our God-given potential in other areas of life. There’s interplay between individuality—it’s you on the mat all by yourself—and at the same time, the solidarity of the team creates meaningful and transformative bonds.” \n\nSegura agrees. “Wrestling helps me find connection between me and God,” she said. “Sometimes I’ll pray for guidance, or to keep the wrestlers safe. But not for a wish to win. God doesn’t work that way.”\nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

I learned if something is hard, staying with it and trying new approaches is better than taking a break and then going back to doing the same thing over and over.”\nReyes was one of a growing number of female students who participate annually in Regis Jesuit’s Robotics Club. She discovered her interest in STEM when she attended the Porter-Billups Leadership Academy at Regis University, which provides academic and leadership training to at-risk inner-city students in the Denver area. This fall, she will begin college at Regis U as an aspiring computer science and engineering major. “Knowing they follow the same Jesuit teaching and morals I had for the past four years made me feel safe,” she says. \n\nYet Reyes also is perfectly comfortable with risk. At the club fair held during her first weeks at Regis Jesuit, she introduced herself to members of the Robotics Club. “They said I could build on what I’d done, and they encouraged me to challenge myself even more.” By sophomore year, Reyes was one of a handful leaders of the co-ed club, and in her junior year, became the captain. The next year, she became a senior mentor. “Single-ed classes provided a space where we could be ourselves,” she said. “Then, when the boys and girls came together to collaborate and build things together, we could appreciate each other for what we brought to the team.” She credited the club’s mentors—who came from Lockheed Martin, Boeing, the Colorado School of Mines and elsewhere—for making sure everyone had equal chance to participate.\n\nKelly Knechtel, Assistant Director for the Women in Science, Engineering and Mathematics Program at the Colorado School of Mines, believes investments in the community, such as the Science & Innovation Center, will give female students access to careers they may not have considered. As adviser to the public university’s 700-member Society of Women Engineers, she’s passionate about reducing barriers for women in STEM. “As we engage the next generation of engineers and scientists, educators need to ensure we are providing women with learning experiences, mentors and affinity groups that broaden their perspectives, inspire their confidence and expand perceptions of their own potential in STEM fields.”\n\nAs both female and male students express curiosity and creativity across many disciplines, Regis Jesuit is moving boldly forward with Inspire & Ignite 2025, its strategic plan for access, innovation and excellence. The addition of the 65,000-square-foot future Science & Innovation Center (SIC) will fill many needs: for new technology and tools, and for more advanced academic offerings in STEM, art and architecture, journalism and other creative fields. It also will likely attract top talent to Regis Jesuit—people such as George Mitsuoka, the newly hired Director of the Innovation Center within the SIC. A graduate of MIT, Mitsuoka has had a varied career as a software engineer, technical writer and volunteer mentor to high school students in Denver for nearly 20 years.

I’ve even begun discussions with our Theology Department about how future service projects can be enhanced by projects such as low-cost water purification for underserved communities.”\n\n“My hope is that students will eventually drive much of what happens within the Innovation Center.

She has been teaching for 30 years: in schools both single-gender and co-educational, public and private, and religious and secular. She’s also the parent to Ian ’15 and Sadie ’18.\n\n\n“A boy playing the violin and a girl playing a violin—there’s nothing different about how they approach the music, from a technical or mechanical perspective,” said Wuertz. “That’s why, in 2014, the boys’ and girls’ orchestras were combined, as was the concert band program. These types of ensembles are stronger with the students together.”\n\n\nBut, Wuertz acknowledged, there often are key differences in the classroom, especially around competition and collaboration. “If I have a short little contest, the boys will bite,” she said. “They’ll play. And that will increase their engagement. In an all-girls class, I’d rather use collaboration to increase buy-in.” \n\n\nAt Regis Jesuit, Wuertz taught just boys until fall 2014, when the Steele Center opened and became the first “declared shared space” on campus. Now, boys and girls socialize together on the green, in the café and in performing arts spaces—though most classes are held separately.\n\n\nWith the future Science & Innovation Center (SIC), Wuertz and her counterpart in the Girls Division, Tim Bauer ’88, along with many teachers across both divisions are keen to improve even further on the blend of separate and combined activities that she calls “the best of both worlds.”\n \n“We need large, flexible spaces, where we can move tables and chairs around and facilitate dialogue,” she said. “For example, in a theology or history class, boys and girls often are studying the same texts, only separately. We want everyone to learn from each other, so it will be great to be able to bring them together sometimes, to explore their different perspectives and interactions with the material.”\n\n\nDustin Dvorak, chair of Regis Jesuit’s unified science department serving both boys and girls, says the key to breaking down stereotypes is the one-on-one relationships he has with his students. “And yet, regardless of gender, they all need access to inspiration.”\n\n\nThe new SIC will improve STEM facilities for all students—but especially the girls. “The curiosity students develop in high school is a big driver for continuing on,” said Dvorak. “So, if our girls miss out on the full experience to see concepts in action—through physical demonstrations, chemical reactions, live experiments—it’s possible they may lose interest.” Currently, nine sections of science classes for girls (vs. two for boys) are taught in non-science classrooms.\n\n\nThe SIC will have pods of specialized science classrooms. For example, the four for chemistry will have fume hoods, chemical storage space, and access to gas, sinks and safety equipment. Biology rooms will have grow lights, places for tanks, and refrigerators to store what students will be dissecting. For robotics and engineering classes and co-curricular activities, there will be a new fabrication space with a woodshop, metal shop, jewelry-making tools, a 3-D printer and powerful computers with the software needed to design and build absolutely anything.\n\n\n“Dedicated facilities and equipment will really expand our repertoire of what we can do,” Dvorak said. “And because every science class for boys and girls will be taught in the building, every freshman, sophomore and junior student will be there every other day at a minimum.”\n\n\nHaving equitable space for boys and girls will make a big difference in breaking down stereotypes, which is important to Dvorak and Wuertz, and to all students and teachers at Regis Jesuit. \n\n\nWuertz said: “In our unique model at RJ, we have the opportunity and the responsibility to capitalize on the benefits of single-gender education, as well as to bring the students together for co-educational experiences with intentionality and purpose. Caring for and loving our students starts with setting up a classroom environment where all students can feel safe and included.”\nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

In search of greater challenge, she got herself accepted into the engineering program. Between her junior and senior undergraduate years, she landed a yearlong co-op at a brewery, then found her way to law school at CU Boulder, where she’s now in her second year. She plans to specialize in intellectual property law.\n“One of the things I got from Regis is the strong desire to work with and for others,” she said. “Engineering provides an opportunity for that but it’s a little more indirect, so I started looking at ways I could use all the things I love about engineering—the problem solving, the analytical thinking—in a more direct, interpersonal way. The law is the perfect combination.” \n\nNow, with a mentoring program she helped start at Regis Jesuit, Canino is helping girls plot their future careers. “I wished I had a similar opportunity, especially as a first-generation student. I had no idea what I wanted to study in college, or what career would suit me. I would have benefited if I had college-age women to ask.” Some of her mentees keep in touch for college advice. One even asked Canino to write a recommendation. \n\nCanino’s first four-part mentoring program focused on engineering. It was held in person on campus before the pandemic forced everything online. The sessions filled up immediately, with girls who came to learn about engineering fields and Canino’s college experiences. In a speed-mentoring event, they met briefly with professionals in the field. Recently, Canino and Lauren (Troksa) Knapp ‘14, who is now a practicing lawyer, transitioned the program online and focused on what to expect from law school and beyond. Knapp is the sister of Blake Troksa ’14, whom Canino married in 2019. \n\nMentoring came naturally to Canino. “I just kinda knew what to do,” she said. “I talk to them as friends. I tell them I’m a firm believer in keeping as many doors open as possible; and opening as many as you can for yourself. That principle, which I learned at Regis Jesuit, has shaped my character and led to monumental decisions regarding my career and my family life. The more opportunities you have, the better. Because you don’t necessarily have to decide what to do right away.” \n\nAt Regis Jesuit, Canino played basketball and excelled in academics, but her heart was in service. She served as a leader for Freshman Retreat and Kairos and earned the Dorothy Day Service Award her senior year. In April 2020, moved by the impacts of COVID-19, she started HumanKind Network from her home. Nearly 400 volunteers now provide free virtual tutoring to school kids, free contactless grocery delivery and elderly isolation support.  \n\nWhen Canino talks to her mentees—especially the seniors who may be rushing to the finish line—she has a powerful message that comes from the heart. “You’re getting ready to end a very important chapter of your life and to start a new and exciting one, but you’re the author of your own story. You can either rush through that chapter to get to the next one, or you can take your time and encompass a more meaningful story. Because when you look back, you’re going to want to remember all the wonderful things that came with senior year.” \n\nClearly, Canino’s own story will be exciting to follow!\nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

He said, “Winning is a byproduct of creating an environment in which young men can thrive.”\nBoys Varsity Soccer has won the League Championship the last four years in a row. They ranked number one in the state last year, and they only gave up a single goal in their entire season—in the final seconds of regulation play during the first round of the playoffs.\n\n\nWolf prepares his players for what he believes is most important in life, regardless of their sport. “I tell them that soccer will end at some point. They might get cut early, or they might have a 12-year professional run like Roger Espinoza ’05. So, the question is, what are they taking from the game that will make them a better person. What matters most is their relationship with each other and with God.” \n\n\nEspinoza plays Major League Soccer with Sporting Kansas City. He has also represented his homeland of Honduras at two World Cups and the 2012 Summer Olympics and now helps raise money and awareness to improve the lives of Hondurans. Espinoza and Wolf still keep in touch, as is the case with many alumni players who found a strong sense of family on the team.\n\n\nThe recent success of Boys Soccer, according to Wolf, is due in large part to the dedication of his two assistant coaches, Derek Scarth and Tommy Gilhooley. “They genuinely love the kids, and they love the mission—which is a beautiful mission. Their presence has further empowered me to embrace it and love it and put it on display for everyone to see.” \n\n\nScarth and Gilhooley both were star players at Regis University and have what Wolf calls an “equal stake” in the success of the team. “We complement each other,” Wolf said. “Derek does strategy and tactics. Tommy encourages the kids to observe the other players. Each of us has a group of lads we connect with so if someone is struggling, we know who should talk to them.”\n\n\nLeadership is an important value for the players and coaches. Many of the players serve as retreat leaders and frequently take on other formal and informal leadership roles throughout the school. The team maintains a 3.6 grade point average and nearly all made the Academic All-State team. Wolf says they are “easy accepts to any institution, whether or not they play.” \n\n\nTransforming athletics into a conduit for mission and leadership—known as Bold Move Four—is an important part of Inspire & Ignite 2025, Regis Jesuit’s Strategic Vision for Access, Innovation and Excellence. According to Wolf, having side-by-side playing fields is the one improvement that will help the most. In fact, that project is on the horizon for use by nearly 750 students, or 40 percent of Regis Jesuit’s student-athletes, who play field sports. This includes Boys Soccer and Girls Soccer, as well as Lacrosse and Rugby for both boys and girls, Field Hockey and Football, where leadership and mentorship also matter. \n\n\n“The role of the older players is to set an example for the younger ones,” said Wolf, who oversees the Freshman, Junior Varsity and Varsity Boys teams encompassing more than 80 players from freshman through their senior years. “We’ve done a lot to elevate the leadership of our older boys, but there’s a huge disconnect because our teams are physically separated and have to play at separate times. Our goal is to use the sport of soccer as an opportunity to form our boys as players, teammates, men and, most importantly, to grow in our relationship with God. Our older boys, who have a solid faith life, demand that respect from their younger teammates. I’d love to see them spend more time together.” \nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

As faculty adviser to the student-run RJ Media program, he is cultivating critical thinkers and active listeners, who express their humanity and compassion through telling stories.  \n \nHe said, “Journalism is the perfect way to teach students about ‘others’—and also to inspire them to fight for more justice and solidarity.”\nDawkins led the 2019 service immersion trip to Tijuana, Mexico, where 10 students, gathered source material for their social documentary Crossing Borders. The film, now being screened for the public, is sparking deep conversations about migration. Dawkins’ next yearlong generative journalism course will explore homelessness in Denver. \n \n“Generative journalism allows us to be hyper-focused on a theme or issue that is grounded in our Jesuit mission, our Catholic social teaching and our faith,” Dawkins said. “Then, all the work we do, all the stories we find and tell, can be directed at amplifying the message and uplifting voices in the community.” \n \nAfter many years of steady growth, journalism classes and extracurricular media activities now engage 600-700 students per year, from the Concordia yearbook and Elevate magazine, to the weekly RJTV broadcast news show and live broadcasts of Raider sports and events. As RJ Media racks up awards from the Colorado Student Media Association, Journalism Education Association and National Scholastic Press Association, it needs more creative and flexible space.  \n \nErika Rasmussen ’16, who took journalism classes and freelanced a few stories while at Regis Jesuit, is now on a yearlong journalism fellowship in New York, at America Media, a Jesuit media ministry that produces America magazine and other properties. She recalls RJ Media’s move to the Steele Center in 2014. “Having a dedicated space that belonged to all students made all the difference,” she said. “Everyone felt welcome, and we were able to learn in community in a completely new way.” \n \nRJ Media’s next move to the future Science & Innovation Center will enable the program to have even wider impact on campus and beyond—by orders of magnitude. With three video and audio editing rooms, a circular stage, an LED screen and plenty of space for collaboration and team-teaching, the new interdisciplinary building will expand and enhance the teaching of all aspects of professional filmmaking and journalism.  \n \nRasmussen, who graduated from Santa Clara University in 2020 with majors in English and sociology and minors in Spanish and creative writing, is exploring what Joe Hoover, SJ, the poetry editor at America, described to her as: “the many rooms in my father’s house of journalism,” a reference to John 14:2. With mentorship from Hoover and others, she is learning about audio and video production and social media, writing stories on assignment and pitching ideas of her own. Her subjects have been relevant and complex, ranging from coronavirus vaccine ethics and how Jesuit universities tackle implicit bias, to the death penalty and the Netflix adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's 1938 novel Rebecca. \n \nWhatever the future holds, Rasmussen knows she wants to live her life “in a way that brings others into love and a sense of belonging and belovedness.” And that goal squares perfectly with what she learned at Regis Jesuit, and from Dawkins and RJ Media. \n \n“I’ve known since I was five years old that I want to be a writer,” she said. “I’m supposed to tell stories and to write them. I’m realizing now that stories are life, and stories are life giving. I’m being affirmed that my desire to do this is how I can love others—and we can love one another.”\nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

Now, as is true with so many aspects of a Jesuit education, innovative ideas and new tools are ensuring that the Ignatian vision of service—to create a more just, humane and sustainable world—has even greater impact.\nBeginning in fall 2021, a new Ignatian Immersion & Solidarity Program takes all Regis Jesuit students on a four-year journey that will enhance service placements and the Capstone Project with the building of specific skills over time. Year one expands students’ understanding of community. Year two explores how to be in authentic relationship with neighbors. Year three begins to teach students about justice and ways to create access and opportunity for vulnerable communities. Year four asks students to apply their skills to help lift up the voices of the ignored and unheard. Using new software, students will record their activity and answer increasingly complex questions that inspire them to reflect on what they learn.\n\n\n“The framework of counting hours—which has long been the norm at high schools and colleges across the country—can be an obstacle to achieving our goals,” said Christina Ortiz, Ignatian Immersion & Solidarity Program Director and theology teacher, who earned her master’s degree in theology from the Jesuit School of Theology in Berkeley. \n\n\n“Service isn’t a one-way transaction,” she said, “so while our students are putting in the time, we also want to be sure we’re teaching active listening skills, empathy, compassion and communication, so they’ll see the larger issues.” Ortiz said this level of formation has always been accessible to students at Regis Jesuit, but they had to discover it, or luck into it with the right mentors. “Now, we’ll make sure every student has this depth of experience. Ultimately, we hope they’ll find a vocational call to help promote justice and help build the kingdom of God on Earth.” \n\n\nFor Patrick Cole ’99, now a special education teacher in Denver, service during high school “planted a seed, which took a long time to develop.” His placement at Warren Village, a residential facility for single mothers who had experienced homelessness and food insecurity, exposed him for the first time to “children who needed some more support.” His advisor’s praise that he had the “patience, energy and intellect to work with children,” led him to pursue a master’s in education leadership and administration from Regis University after earning his bachelor’s degree from Creighton University in Omaha, where he met his wife Catherine, who now teaches theology at Regis Jesuit.\n\n\nCole became a special education teacher at Asbury Elementary School after teaching mainstream students for four years, then taking a hiatus to work in business. “I wasn’t fulfilled just making money, and a career coach helped me remember me that the only job I ever loved was working with kids. It all goes back to my experience in my junior year at Warren Village. That’s where I discovered my desire to help the marginalized. I wanted to help educate a part of society that I thought could use some love.” \n\n\nCole now is the site supervisor at Asbury Elementary, working with about eight Regis Jesuit students a year who come to volunteer for two weeks with children who have multiple disabilities. He tries to pair the juniors and seniors with activities they’ll enjoy, “because if they are having fun, they’ll also experience the power of helping kids feel loved and successful. They’ll see how their work impacts lives.”\n\n\nHe said, “The new service program will enhance what already distinguishes Regis Jesuit from other schools that offer great academics. I never would have done this work if it weren’t for Regis Jesuit. I landed in the right place, but if I’d done more reflection earlier in my life, it might not have taken so long for my calling to manifest.”\nBack\n  \nPat Cole '99\nPat Cole '99\nback\nnext",

But first, she had to convince her busy mother that the sport wouldn’t dominate the family’s schedule. Her two parents are doctors. She and her three siblings already were involved in many activities. And academics had to come first.\n“Open gym fell on a Saturday and lucky for me my mother was busy that day and my father agreed to take me,” said Belibi, who was a freshman on that auspicious September day. She now attends Stanford, where she plays basketball on a full scholarship. The Cardinal recently won the national NCAA championship for the first time in 29 years.\n \n“I didn’t yet know a layup from a free-throw, but I stood out because I was tall and could jump really high. So suddenly, I went from a student who did school and played tennis on the side, to someone who wanted to play basketball and could maybe even go to college for basketball. That day changed how I saw myself and how I saw achieving my goals.”\n \nBelibi practiced hard, and by sophomore year became the first female high school player in Colorado to dunk the ball during game play. Now, she’s the eighth woman ever to make that shot in the history of college basketball. Academics are also important. “I’d always been drawn to science and math,” she said, “but at Regis I found I liked everything: the humanities, history, all of my English classes and all of the teachers who taught me.” She said the structure of longer class blocks, combined with the rigor and high expectations, prepared her for Stanford—as a student, an athlete and leader.\n \nBelibi is modest about her success, and she easily shares the credit: with her teammates, her coaches, her family, her teachers and God.\n \n“Everything I’ve accomplished is because of His protection and His blessing,” she said. “God softened my parents’ hearts so I could play. And science will tell you it’s hard for women to dunk a basketball because of the shape of our hips, and how much muscle power is needed. I have big hands and long arms, but I’m only 6’1” and there’s no way I should be able to get myself that high. At the end of the day, it’s pretty miraculous that I can dunk.”\n \nBut Belibi isn’t letting one sensational shot define her. She’s majoring in human biology and plans to become a pediatrician like her mother, rather than turning pro. “Dunking is cool, there’s no doubt about it, but I’m still me. I’m a sister. I’m a teenager. I watch a lot of Netflix. I cook and bake. I wish I could read more. And I’m kind of funny. In fact, I think I’m hilarious, though my family might disagree.”\n \nFor now, Belibi is planning a few moves into the future. She’s taking courses in physiology, adolescent brain development and the art of pediatric diagnosis. She said, “I want to understand how humans become who they are, which starts with children. Kids are the ones who will fix the mistakes we make, so it will be important to empower them.”\n \nBelibi says her career in medicine will combine science and faith. “People assume you can only believe in God or in science, but the world shouldn’t put so much emphasis on either or. In science, first you see it and then you believe it. Faith is believing in something you can’t necessarily see. There are so many aspects of medicine that are science, but at the end of the day, I still believe in miracles.”\nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

She has a concrete plan; she has allies; and she has the wisdom that only can come from personal experience. \n \nWith the participation and support of fellow students and school administration, Leaffer is helping create an environment where more girls and boys at Regis Jesuit are willing to seek mental health support when they need it.\n“Mental health is a problem and I hate that it’s so stigmatized,” Leaffer said. “During my sophomore year, the pandemic hit, which made things worse all across the country. It really tore my heart apart, because, even before, a lot of kids didn’t feel like they could share their problems.” \n \nLeaffer is as fascinated with the human brain and behavior as she is with horses. When not reading or studying for Mr. Walsweer’s psychology classes or exploring the subject on her own time, she spends some 25 hours a week riding and training as a show jumper. To raise money for mental health projects at Regis Jesuit and elsewhere, she works at a barn, mucking stalls and feeding and grooming horses, including two of her own. She travels to events around the country and hopes to compete in college and one day, make it to the Fédération Équestre Internationale Jumping World Cup.  \n \nLeaffer grew up in an interfaith home. Her father is Jewish and her mother Catholic, whom she said, “always trusted me to believe in whatever I chose.” She was attracted to Regis Jesuit for its Catholic values and what she calls the “demeanor” of the school. “I love religion and history, so the curriculum looked perfect.” She had heard that Jesuit education encompassed the whole person, so she believed she wouldn’t have to sacrifice her riding as long as she got her schoolwork done. She also hoped she could continue to advocate for more transparency around mental health.\n \nNow in her junior year, Leaffer is working closely with Dana Bauer, Assistant Principal of Student Support, to bring more student voices into the conversation about mental health issues. The timing has been perfect, because, under Bauer, whose administrative role is new this school year, the school has begun integrating all health and counseling services across campus to provide a more holistic approach. Bauer had been a school counselor at Regis Jesuit for many years.\n\n\nBauer now oversees 20 people in five departments, including Learning Services, School Counseling and College Counseling. “Students cannot be fully successful in academics if their mental health is not the number one priority,” she said. “We are a unique environment, where cura personalis—the care and concern of the whole person—permeates everything we do. Katherine has helped us see how important it is to hear from the students exactly what it is they need and how they want to proceed at Regis Jesuit.” \n \nTogether, Bauer and Leaffer have organized a student advisory committee, and they are creating an open forum for students to share their stories and be heard by the administration. At the first meeting, students spoke openly about what services they need, what the school is doing well and what blind spots exist. After reviewing a list of the many services and programs the school could add, Leaffer’s family—and Katherine herself—provided seed funding to ensure that Regis Jesuit’s one part-time school therapist could expand her hours to full-time. The school also is hiring a second full-time therapist, and recently was awarded a grant by the University of Colorado to implement Botvin LifeSkills Training for incoming high school students to help them build skills to navigate the challenges they face. \n \nAdditional fundraising efforts will make more financial and community supports available for students and integrate more student-led programming into the school day. Programs such as individual counseling, therapy options and counseling groups will continue, but more resources will be added as additional student needs are identified. \n  \n“Everyone’s heart is in this,” said Bauer, who now has a long list of initiatives that will help the Raider community. “Gaining support shouldn’t be a hard sell. But we can’t afford to wait. Thanks to Katherine, we’ve got a lot of students who are as passionate as she is.”   \nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

Four years later, the Las Vegas and Morrison schools were merged in the College of the Sacred Heart—which later became Regis College and then Regis University—and moved to West 52nd Avenue and Lowell Boulevard in northwest Denver.\n\nIn 1921, the high school and college were formally separated into two distinct entities. In 1979, they became separate corporations. With the completion of a new high school building on the college campus in 1984, Regis Jesuit High School moved out of the Regis University facilities, but soon outgrew that building as well. On September 16, 1989, the cornerstone was laid for the new campus in Aurora, Colorado. Classes began on the Campbell Campus the following September.\n\nIn January 1997, Regis Jesuit purchased an additional 35 acres adjacent to the Campbell Campus in hopes of expanding the campus at some point. In 2001, the Board of Trustees, with the support of the Archdiocese of Denver, voted to open a second division of the school. The addition would offer the same high quality, single-gender educational experience to young women as the school had offered young men since its inception. On April 11, 2003, ground was broken for a new facility for the Boys Division, and plans were made to renovate the existing school building for the arrival of the Girls Division in 2004.\n\nIn the fall of 2003, the Girls Division opened at St. Catherine’s Greek Orthodox Church with 170 freshmen and sophomores. For the 2004-05 school year, the Girls Division moved into their refurbished building on the Campbell Campus, while the Boys Division started classes in their new building on the same campus. With the addition of the Girls Division, Regis Jesuit became only the second Jesuit school in the world to offer an all-girls education (the other is in the Philippines) and is the only co-divisional Jesuit school in the country.\n\nIn February 2014, the Steele Center, containing facilities for the performing arts, communications, college counseling as well as a student commons area, opened between the two Divisions. It was originally called the Performing Arts Center & Student Commons but was renamed in June 2015 in honor of Rev. Philip G. Steele, SJ ’66, who served as the school’s President from 2006-15. With facilities intended for use by all students, it is both the physical and spiritual heart of the school. A statue of the school’s patron, St. John Francis Regis, by Bolivian-born artist, Pablo Eduardo, was installed in front of the Steele Center in October 2016, further enlivening this shared space.\n\nOne of the school’s strategic objectives, securing the last piece of open property adjacent to the campus, was accomplished in April 2017 when an additional 18 acres of land was purchased from the long-time owner. How this additional land, which brings the campus size to 82 acres, will be used will be determined through a master planning process currently underway.\n\nDuring the 2017-18 school year, the school celebrated 140 years since its founding by noting the tremendous journey of the institution thus far and looking toward the future with great hope.\nBack",

The ultimate goal of the summit centered around developing true Global Competence among the participants.

The topics for the issues we focused on came from three of the United Nation’s 17 Social Development Goals (SDGs): gender equality, affordable and clean energy and zero hunger. \n\n\nFor three consecutive Saturdays in March, we met on Zoom to discuss how these three topics apply to all our diverse communities. The more than 100 student participants were split into three sections based on the SDG on which we chose to focus. Within those three sections, we were divided into smaller groups of five or six students with the same SDG that became our group for the remainder of the Saturdays. At each session, a UN leader joined us to give us more in-depth information on the SDG that we then took to our small group for student-led discussions about how to address the issue on a smaller scale in our own communities. \n\n\nI focused on the SDG of gender equality, and my small group consisted of male and female students from Jesuit schools in India, Poland, France, Chile and Columbia. Learning new information and gaining perspective from students in these other countries was an amazing experience of encounter as we shared how working to the goal of gender equality could benefit each of us individually. I was able to befriend people from all over the world while also collaborating with them on solutions for an issue that means a lot to me personally. In our small group, we had no trouble sharing great ideas, but we did struggle focus in and narrow them down to a common goal. While communication was one of our strong points, typical teenage procrastination proved to be somewhat of an obstacle. Even though we found it challenging to get things done within the hour session we had to work with each week, we got along very well and collaborated intensely. The final Saturday, we presented our solutions to other SDG groups and received constructive criticism on our approach to the goal.\n\n\nWhat gender equality means to me could mean something entirely different for someone who lives in France—it is such a big goal and trying to solve such a big problem in a short timeframe was difficult. This experience taught me so much about the importance of first steps and exposing yourself to a global-scale problem. There are smaller steps that we can all take to achieve gender equality globally. This opportunity offered me so much more knowledge about gender equality and how I can advocate and inform others about the problem. I am thrilled that I could participate in this experience as it opened a whole new world of curiosity and knowledge. When I think of advocacy now, I realize that I must consider how the issue at hand can relate to those around the world.\nBack\n  \nMichelle Chinn '22\nMichelle Chinn '22\nback\nnext",

Regis Jesuit was one of 21 Jesuit schools across 11 different time zones that took part in the summit, which focuses on  a \"common mission and vision to collaboratively explore solutions to the challenges and injustices we face as a global community.\"\n\nReflection on the Jesuit Global Activism Student Leadership Summit\nBy Sofia Rivera '24\n\nThis summer, some students including myself were given the opportunity to CHANGE THE WORLD! We all were lucky enough to participate in the 2022 Jesuit Global Activism Leadership Summit which is geared to engage students from different countries to participate in an action to collaboratively explore solutions to the challenges and injustices we face as a global community. More than 150 students came together over Zoom from different countries and Jesuit schools to create an inspiring community.\nWhat personally drew me to join this program during my summer was the opportunity to be a part of something bigger. It was crazy to believe that so many students from multiple backgrounds all believed that we need to change how we are living now to save our future, and it was something I couldn’t miss. Another RJ student who also participated, Rhegan McCall '24, said, “I was really interested in being involved during the summer because it gave me the chance to meet many people from around the world, which normally would be more difficult in the school year. It also gave me the opportunity to spend much more time on the project my group was assigned to have an amazing product!”\n\n\nAlthough it sounds like we got the hang of the different time zones quickly, there were definitely some fears in the beginning. What was most terrifying to me was the pressure to create a project with a group of strangers that could make an impact on the world ALL IN A WEEK! But we have all proven that it can certainly be done. \n\n\nOn the first day, I already learned at least one thing from everyone in my group. Everyone was so kind and respectful, not to mention their English was almost better than mine. It was exciting to see how easy it was to communicate with someone who was completely different than me. One of the coolest things I learned was from my teammate Lorenzo. His school is actively taking steps into lowering its usage of emission gasses, and it inspired me to see what I can do here at Regis Jesuit.\n\n\nEvery participant chose a Universal Apostolic Preference (UAP) group to focus on during the summit. with 6-7 students working together to create an action plan that is special to their UAP. The four UAPs are Showing The Way To God, Walking With The Excluded, Journeying With Youth and Caring for our Common Home. My group chose Caring for our Common Home and created a presentation on different reusable energies that could be used to inform global leaders. The most significant thing that I learned from my group’s UAP is that even small actions that help the fight against global warming are important. You don’t have to donate thousands of dollars a month to an organization that recycles (although that would be outstanding) but reducing your plastic usage also makes a difference. \n\n\nFellow RJ student Rhiann Johnson '24 who also focused on the same UAP stated, “Now that I’ve participated I see myself having a more conscious behavior of how much I take from the environment around me. I’m more aware of how much electricity and water I use as well as the people around me. I’ve started using LED lights around my house because they use less energy and have started filtering my water, so I don’t use as much.” \n\n\nAs students, we need to understand that we are the future. If we want to continue to live in the beautiful environment we have today, we must lead by example. I ask that students around the world realize that if you start to use less plastic, walk more than drive, take those above and beyond steps, people will notice. Then they can join you, and more and more people will start to care for our earth. \n\n\nYou don’t realize how huge the Jesuit community actually is until you see it. I only saw a small piece of the Jesuit connection, but it was heartwarming to know that there are other people that share the same ideas and want to be and do better together. I learned so much about the challenges millions face around the world, I dove deep into new perspectives and was able to meet so many nice students. I really am grateful for this opportunity and hope to share it with others next year!\nBack\n  \nSofia Rivera '24\nL-R: Ms. Sarah Sherwood, Ms. Elvira Dominguez, Rhegan McCall '24, Sofia Rivera '24, Ms. Christina Vela, Olivia Bendon '24, Rhiann Johnson '24 and Oscar Saucedo '25\nSofia Rivera '24\nL-R: Ms. Sarah Sherwood, Ms. Elvira Dominguez, Rhegan McCall '24, Sofia Rivera '24, Ms. Christina Vela, Olivia Bendon '24, Rhiann Johnson '24 and Oscar Saucedo '25\nback\nnext",

Students Lyric Swift '23 and Reza Moaddeli '23 share their reflections on their experiences from this year and the importance of this annual event. \n\n\nDiversity Day has got to be one of the peak Regis Jesuit experiences and is a day that we look forward to as soon as the school year begins. It is an amazing experience where we all come together as one community to learn about new things. It is a day that is not just for the student body, but also for the faculty to gain a new and fresh perspective by hearing the stories that people are willing to share with us. Though both juniors, we had slightly different experiences this year as one of us was purely a participant and one was a workshop presenter. Both experiences offered us opportunities to grow.\nThe keynote speakers are always intriguing and really set the tone for the day. We still remember the keynote from freshman year: Sr. Helen Prejean. Sr. Helen is a pro-life activist who speaks against the death penalty. Her speech was a powerful life lesson on the importance of human life. The compassion Sr. Helen has for every person is an admirable trait that we can all learn from. This year, we hosted Ms. Gloria Purvis, who had a very similar message. Ms. Purvis is an African-American author, commentator and host of the Gloria Purvis Podcast hosted by AMERICA Media. She spoke to us about the intersectionality of supporting the Black Lives Matter movement and being pro-life. She was very clear that both deal with the importance of human life. She was equally clear that we all bring so many things to who we are as people. \n\n\nDiversity Day is truly one of the parts of Regis Jesuit that teaches the whole person. The keynote speakers share things that we are going through and already have encountered in our day-to-day lives. We are introduced to ideas that come from a variety of cultures and perspectives on things we have been taught and those that are outside of our normal experiences, but everything touches on who we are as humans in this world.\n\n\nBeyond the keynote, we love the different options for the great workshop sessions Diversity Day allows us to engage in. If there is a topic you’d like to learn more about, there is most likely a workshop for it. Getting the chance to be with our friends, pick great sessions and learn about new things all in one day makes it exciting. We often wish Diversity Day was Diversity Week instead because there are so many good workshops it is hard to choose just three. We stressed picking our workshops this year until we remembered that it’s not about what sessions you pick. You could pick the “worst” one and still have a great experience because you get out what you put into it. Diversity Day teaches you that everyone’s story is different, and everyone has challenges that help them get where there are. We learned that in all our sessions this year. \n\n\nLyric's Reflection\nOne of the things that challenged me to grow during Diversity Day, besides being presented with all the new ideas and possibilities, was stepping out of my comfort zone and picking sessions that my friends were not attending. I knew that if I picked different sessions, it would help me focus and also grow because I would not be worried about what my friends are doing. One of the workshops that really resonated with me this year was “Real Life Conversations With Mrs. Ames.” It was a panel discussion with several people who willingly shared their stories and the lesson that they learned from their experiences. It was really powerful. The main lesson that I learned was that you cannot let your past define you. What you can do is start where you are now and continue from there to make a better life for yourself. It is never too late to change your life; you just have to have the courage to try.\n\nReza's Reflection\nLeading a workshop this year was amazing. In November, I went to Washington DC for the Ignatian Family Teach-In for Justice (IFTJ) with a group of students from Regis Jesuit. IFTJ is a gathering of students from all over the country who are committed to working for justice as our Catholic faith calls us to do. At IFTJ, we listened to a speech from Fr. Bryan Massingale, a priest who works at Fordham University and is a leader in the field of theological ethics. He spoke on wage gaps and the ways that the gap affects Black vs. white Americans differently.\n\nFr. Massingale shared about a game he plays with his college students that is a spin-off of Monopoly.

Several of the sessions featured student presenters. The conference closed with performances by Regis Chorale and the combined choirs of Canta Belles, Vox Lucis and Regis Chorale followed by a rousing presentation from At the Table with Dr. King, that had the crowd on its feet.

Program Director Christina Ortiz shares this reflection on changes to the program and the insights and impacts these experiences held. \n\nDuring Junior-Senior Immersions, I found myself on the phone with one of the directors at Chelsea Place, a memory care facility that was hosting junior volunteers at the time. We were discussing logistics, but before I got off the phone she said, “I want you to know that your students are doing amazing here. The staff has been taken aback by all of them, in particular one of your junior boys. For the last few days, we have found him just sitting with one of our nonverbal residents, holding her hand. When we asked him if she was talking at all, he smiled and told us, ‘We communicate in different ways.’ It is quite the sight to see a teenage boy—one who looks like he is probably on the football team—sitting in silence with one of our elders, just holding hands.”\nThis has been one of the primary images from immersions this year that stuck with me. In the vision for the IIS Program, we state that this program exists to dissolve real and perceived barriers between our students and the wider global, interconnected world. Dissolving those barriers requires so much of our students: humility, flexibility, patience, presence and vulnerability, to name a few. Working with vulnerable populations such as the elderly, the poor, the unhoused, the disabled, requires our students to let go of preconceived notions about others and about the world, and to put relationship first. Perhaps the hardest lesson they have to learn is how to be present to people before you try to do anything for them.\n\nThis year, we were not only able to return to our traditional program of sending all 800 juniors and seniors out into the community, but we also began a new tradition of hosting a few small groups of students for an overnight immersion. Two groups of seniors and one group of juniors each committed to a truly immersive experience as they spent an entire week away from their families and friends and instead spent their evenings praying together and reflecting on what they had seen/learned each day at their sites. The seniors worked with Bal Swan preschool which serves a combination of children with special needs and typical needs in Westminster. The juniors volunteered at Tennyson Center, a school and program for at-risk youth who come from abusive and traumatic backgrounds. \n\nThere are many stages of growth our students go through as they process their immersion experiences. Many, such as Sawyer McFarland ’23, start by reflecting on the privileges of their own upbringing, “Working with these kids all week and learning about their stories have put things into perspective for me. I may complain about a test or a bad grade while these kids are just looking to be loved and cared for. Everyone has their own struggles and challenges, but it is important to notice the people who have to fight to be loved. I am very fortunate to be loved and cared for.” \n\nBeyond just appreciating what they have though, we hope that our students are inspired to act to make the world a better place. Katelyn Nelson ’23 thinks a key part of that is overcoming self. “I was able to overcome myself this week at the Tennyson Center by growing in patience, persistence and openness to love… By the end of the week, my perspective that our job as volunteers was to directly help the kids, developed into the perspective that our main job was to support them on their journey.” Molly Nichols ’23 learned that embracing uncomfortable experiences is crucial to loving others. “It was an intimidating environment and I didn’t feel comfortable, not once. I think, though, that that is the point of immersion.” She goes on to say that she had to learn to see people for their whole, authentic selves “rather than stand in judgment at how they carry their own cross across the broken path they’ve been placed on.”\n \nPerhaps the most unexpected part of immersions for our students is learning how much they themselves long to be accepted and loved. High school can feel like a very unforgiving, unkind place for many teenagers. Many of them struggle with the feelings of not being ‘enough’, whether that’s in the classroom, on the field or the stage or in the hallways. In their day-to-day lives though, they feel they must hide those insecurities and bury them deep enough inside so that no one can see them. The very idea of being a vulnerable person though means that their insecurities and “shortcomings” are right on the surface for everyone to see. As our students engage with the kind, generous, patient and, oftentimes, hilarious guests/clients at their sites, they learn how much strength can be found in vulnerability. \n\nBefore immersions start, we ask our students to reflect on their feelings going in. Almost all of them express a fear that they won’t be good enough for their site or that they won’t know how to help. On the first day, they are amazed at how welcome they feel right away. Some are greeted by young children who immediately want to be their best friend, no questions asked. Others are welcomed to conversations and activities with guests/clients, and they are surprised that they are the ones being taken care of rather than the other way around. Rahel Seyoum ’23 reflected early in her immersion, “In my family, it’s tradition for the children to sit at a separate table during the holidays. When I was younger, all I wanted was a seat at the table—to be an integral part of something bigger than myself and to have a space where I could voice my opinions without fear. As I grew older, this desire manifested in a need for diversity and inclusion without the toll of discrimination and without the need for conformity. Today, I got a seat at the table. Today, I became a part of something larger than myself. Today, I spent time with three of the most amazing and inspiring Black men that I have ever met…I look up to these men, and I am grateful that, today, they offered me a seat at the table.” \n\nSo much of the human experience is rooted in a desire to belong; to feel that someone genuinely cares. Immersions are just a little reminder for our students that there is a place for everyone at God’s table.\nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

The delegation participated in webinars and online presentations throughout the conference, including a direct discussion with the UN Youth Ambassador, as well as visited and learned more about several local organizations that share in the mission of promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women.\nThe United Nations Commission on the Status of Women is a gathering of people from all over the world to discuss the work being done to promote the access and participation of women and girls in education, training, science and technology, including the promotion of women’s equal access to full employment. The commission has been taking place for the last 26 years through the subcommittee UN Women. Regis Jesuit's participation allows us to engage in this global social justice issue through dialogue with people from all over the world and bring what we learned back to our school community. \n\n\nWhile conventionally an in-person trip to the United Nations in New York City, both last year's and this year's delegations participated virtually in the UN CSW’s programming due to health and safety concerns surrounding COVID-19. In 2021, the delegation gathered on the Regis Jesuit campus to attend virtual sessions. This year, students enjoyed a hybrid experience of the conference, attending sessions virtually while also engaging in person with different organizations here in Denver working towards the same goals as UN Women. These organizations include Regis University, The Denver Center for Performing Arts, Comal Heritage Food Incubator, CIRCLE/STAMP, Florence Crittenton School, Re:Vision and the Women’s Homeless Initiative through the Regis University Safe Outdoor Space. This year’s hybrid experience provided a meaningful and impactful opportunity for our students to explore these important issues more closely. \nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

She also spoke to a group of about 30 students at lunch and to more than 80 parents and other adults from across the metro area Catholic community in the evening, sharing her strong Catholic voice for life issues, religious liberty and racial justice with each group. \nIn addition to attending the keynote, students had the opportunity to attend three workshops each from a list of nearly 70 options featuring a variety of topics to help expose them to new arenas or perspectives. Several of the sessions featured student presenters. The conference closed with performances by Regis Chorale and the combined choirs of Canta Belles, Vox Lucis and Regis Chorale followed by a rousing presentation from At the Table with Dr. King, that had the crowd on its feet.

Writing two to three letters a month, the students participating offer a connection point to people experiencing the isolation of detention. The letters offer hope to immigrants who spend much of their time alone and away from their families. This program has created an opportunity for students to wrestle with the challenge of writing a first letter introducing themselves to someone they don’t know. It also allows them to spend time emotionally connecting with people from all over the world as well as the United States. Writing letters and just being WITH someone at such a difficult time in their lives is what it truly means to be a Man or Woman WITH and for Others.\nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

Since its inception 25 years ago, people from around the world have gathered to discuss the work being done to promote access to and participation of women and girls in education, training, science and technology, including the promotion of women’s equal access to full employment. \nSince 2014, Regis Jesuit has sent a delegation of students to participate in this impactful opportunity. Normally, we send 12 juniors and seniors with chaperones to New York City in March to take part. Because of the virtual nature of this year’s event, 18 current students and four adults were able to participate. Dylan Aquino ’22, Alejandro Casillas ’22, William Lanoha ’22, Luke MacPhee ’22, Samuel Opferman ’22, Joshua Smith ’22, Matthew Tierney ’22, Taylor Cipra ’22, Akon Edwang ’21, Greta Leege ’22, Kathryn Loftus ’22, Jordan Miller ’21, Lily O'Shaughnessy ’22, Elsa Pater ’22, Gwyneth Theobald ’22, Nzana Thillot ’21. Victoria Tuffour ’22 and Rylie Ward ’21 were joined by faculty members Ginger Brown, John Johnson, Mary Muldoon, Chris Vela for this year’s event. Delegate Matthew Tierney ’22 shared his thoughts on the experience.\n\nLearn more about RJ’s effort to gain Consultative Status with the United Nations\n\nOn Our Experience at CSW\nBy Matthew Tierney ’22\n\n\nGoing into the United Nations’ Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), I was excited to see how the international perspectives on women’s issues might overlap with the issues we students are confronted within a high school setting. Despite the limitations placed on our group by coronavirus-related circumstances (we had to attend the presentations online), we walked away with a wealth of knowledge on international women’s issues and the struggle to eliminate them, as well as a greater sense of solidarity and appreciation for activists in several different countries.\n\n\nWhile it was interesting learning about the unique problems women face around the world, like child marriage, the most powerful presentations were often those transcending geography. For instance, CSW forced us to confront head-on the gendered manifestations of digital violence regardless of location. Digital harassment, violence and exploitation are burgeoning issues, and multiple CSW presenters stressed the difficulty of enforcing laws online.\n\nMany members of our group, myself included, also sat in on presentations that dealt with the intersection of women’s issues and labor. We learned from labor activists and researchers of the exacerbated exploitation that women, particularly those in the global south, face at the workplace. One such presentation focused on the working conditions fueling the fast fashion industry, one that, as high school students and Americans, we are often on the consuming end of. Fueled by a hyper-exploited workforce largely in southern countries like Bangladesh, this industry is a perfect example of this intersection of women’s and labor issues. I was struck by the poignancy of this convergence in the presenter’s description of the 2013 Dhaka Garment Factory collapse that occurred after a largely female workforce’s concerns over worker safety went ignored, resulting in an industrial disaster and loss of human life that dwarfs the infamous Triangle Shirtwaist Fire of 1911.\n\n\nBetween presentations, our group held fruitful conversations about the issues that had been presented; specifically, we discussed how we could incorporate knowledge from the CSW into our own community at Regis Jesuit. On digital violence particularly, we felt that we could do more as a school combating it through education. We recognized that direct engagement with topics like sexual harassment that in past years might have been covered through the advisement program or assemblies had to be tabled given the circumstances of the pandemic. So, we brainstormed ways to strengthen education on issues of sexism at Regis Jesuit.\n\n\nBeyond changes on the school level, as students, our crucial takeaway from this experience is the idea that we all have a responsibility to work towards a more just society when it comes to women. As a middle-class American, and, in my case, as a man, I am often sheltered from the worst symptoms of the global situation that I, in many ways, benefit from. At CSW, however, I was exposed, albeit in a detached, academic setting, to the struggles of women around the globe. I also encountered a multitude of wonderful and dedicated people committed to making things better. After we had attended the CSW virtual presentations, we had the privilege of meeting directly with the United States' U.N. Youth Observer, Dustin Liu. He encouraged us to “imagine the world you want.” \n\n\nThe CSW made it powerfully clear that we all have a responsibility and the right to imagine a better world, and the responsibility for creating that world rests on all of us.\nBack\n  \nMatthew Tierney '22\nMatthew Tierney '22\nback\nnext",

We could literally see this family through the peepholes in the wall (we also saw their adorable little boy running around). At the end of the service, we put our hands up on the wall and sent our prayers to all the immigrants waiting to cross. It was incredible that the Regis group along with many others experienced this powerful moment at the same time. It was truly breathtaking.\nRead More\nDAY FOUR - BONDED TOGETHER\n2/4/2023\nThe moment that stuck out today was dancing with the children at the Cultural Center of Kumeyaay Indigenous People. We were gathered to watch them perform traditional dances to celebrate various parts of their lives. After finishing two dances, they invited us to join in for the third. We gathered around an oak tree and followed their steps, swaying from side to side and following closely in a line. We laughed with them, or rather they laughed at our lack of rhythm. Either way, it bonded us together. \nRead More\nDAY THREE - OPENING HEARTS\n2/4/2023\nToday was one of the most beautiful but hectic days. When we woke up we went to the garden at the Wall in Friendship Park and had a really great time. It was a chance to connect with nature and learning about the binational garden was extremely impactful. Working with native plants and learning about the ecosystems was incredible. One of the most impactful moments was when Dan, an American who now lives in TJ and works in the Friendship Park garden, was arguing with Border Patrol about the wall. Next week there is a plan in place to build a 30 foot wall where the current wall is in place. Dan was explaining how badly it would destroy the ecosystems and the natural plant life already living there.\n\n\nRead More\nDAY TWO - MAKING CONNECTIONS\n2/2/2023\nToday we visited Chicano Park in San Diego. This area had been promised to the Chicano community as a park to make amends for the loss of access to the beach because of Naval installations and further degradation of the area due to highway construction. However, in 1969, construction began on a state highway patrol station. This development galvanized Chicano activists and residents of Barrio Logan. As they protested the demanded space for their own to use, the resulting land located under the highway bridges became what is now known as Chicano Park-a Mecca of Chicano art in the San Diego areas. Many of the most prominent murals recognize Latino and Chicano heroes, important historical events, and community members. \nRead More\nDAY ONE - BEGINNING OUR JOURNEY\n2/1/2023\nThe day started at 9 o’clock at DIA. We had a seamless check-in process and got through security in record time. We all checked that our gate existed and then went off to grab a bite before the plane boarded. The plane boarded at 11 and took off shortly after. The flight landed at 1 o’clock California time. We met our partners from Peace Works travels at the airport and headed to the hotel. After dropping off our bags and freshening up we left to go get some lunch in Old Town San Diego.\nRead More\nCURIOSITY AND EXCITEMENT AS WE PREPARE TO DEPART\n1/27/2023\nWhy?\n\nOur Social Documentary class travels to Tijuana, Mexico this Wednesday. While there, we will be documenting our experiences and immersing ourselves in the local communities. Interviews, garden work, and a variety of different activities are lined up for us. Busy work and packing lists dot the boards, and zoom calls with our guides have helped breathe life into the reality of our departure next week.\nRead More\nView All News",

Regis Jesuit High School seeks to maintain an atmosphere that is conducive to the highest quality of learning and animates the mission of our school. In an effort to maintain structures for students that will help their growth in maturity, personal responsibility and self-discipline, Regis Jesuit institutes a Dress Code policy. The Dress Code aims to limit distractions from learning and engagement in our community, invites equity between students in the ways they present themselves and provides students with clear expectations about forms of dress. The school believes that appropriate dress and appearance reflect good motivation, sensitivity to others and respect for oneself and for the school community. \n\nIt is the responsibility of students, parents/guardians and staff to implement this code. Changes to dress code expectations can be made at any time to meet the needs of the community. Students out of dress code may be kept out of class resulting in an unexcused absence or unexcused tardy. Regis Jesuit High School reserves the right to send any student out of dress code home. When on campus, students must be dressed within the dress code guidelines, including before and after co-curricular practices and during school-sponsored events. Students may be sent home if they are wearing inappropriate attire at co-curricular events.

Bob was an active member of Regis Jesuit's First Friday Mass choir. \n\n\"Bob was born on January 20, 1940, in Corpus Christi, Texas, and enjoyed an active and very sociable life until his death at age 83.

She has a concrete plan; she has allies; and she has the wisdom that only can come from personal experience. \n \nWith the participation and support of fellow students and school administration, Leaffer is helping create an environment where more girls and boys at Regis Jesuit are willing to seek mental health support when they need it.\n“Mental health is a problem and I hate that it’s so stigmatized,” Leaffer said. “During my sophomore year, the pandemic hit, which made things worse all across the country. It really tore my heart apart, because, even before, a lot of kids didn’t feel like they could share their problems.” \n \nLeaffer is as fascinated with the human brain and behavior as she is with horses. When not reading or studying for Mr. Walsweer’s psychology classes or exploring the subject on her own time, she spends some 25 hours a week riding and training as a show jumper. To raise money for mental health projects at Regis Jesuit and elsewhere, she works at a barn, mucking stalls and feeding and grooming horses, including two of her own. She travels to events around the country and hopes to compete in college and one day, make it to the Fédération Équestre Internationale Jumping World Cup.  \n \nLeaffer grew up in an interfaith home. Her father is Jewish and her mother Catholic, whom she said, “always trusted me to believe in whatever I chose.” She was attracted to Regis Jesuit for its Catholic values and what she calls the “demeanor” of the school. “I love religion and history, so the curriculum looked perfect.” She had heard that Jesuit education encompassed the whole person, so she believed she wouldn’t have to sacrifice her riding as long as she got her schoolwork done. She also hoped she could continue to advocate for more transparency around mental health.\n \nNow in her junior year, Leaffer is working closely with Dana Bauer, Assistant Principal of Student Support, to bring more student voices into the conversation about mental health issues. The timing has been perfect, because, under Bauer, whose administrative role is new this school year, the school has begun integrating all health and counseling services across campus to provide a more holistic approach. Bauer had been a school counselor at Regis Jesuit for many years.\n\n\nBauer now oversees 20 people in five departments, including Learning Services, School Counseling and College Counseling. “Students cannot be fully successful in academics if their mental health is not the number one priority,” she said. “We are a unique environment, where cura personalis—the care and concern of the whole person—permeates everything we do. Katherine has helped us see how important it is to hear from the students exactly what it is they need and how they want to proceed at Regis Jesuit.” \n \nTogether, Bauer and Leaffer have organized a student advisory committee, and they are creating an open forum for students to share their stories and be heard by the administration. At the first meeting, students spoke openly about what services they need, what the school is doing well and what blind spots exist. After reviewing a list of the many services and programs the school could add, Leaffer’s family—and Katherine herself—provided seed funding to ensure that Regis Jesuit’s one part-time school therapist could expand her hours to full-time. The school also is hiring a second full-time therapist, and recently was awarded a grant by the University of Colorado to implement Botvin LifeSkills Training for incoming high school students to help them build skills to navigate the challenges they face. \n \nAdditional fundraising efforts will make more financial and community supports available for students and integrate more student-led programming into the school day. Programs such as individual counseling, therapy options and counseling groups will continue, but more resources will be added as additional student needs are identified. \n  \n“Everyone’s heart is in this,” said Bauer, who now has a long list of initiatives that will help the Raider community. “Gaining support shouldn’t be a hard sell. But we can’t afford to wait. Thanks to Katherine, we’ve got a lot of students who are as passionate as she is.”   \nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

The headline read: “In the startup world, listening is key.”\n\n\nIt turns out that listening not only been the key to Armistead’s success in businesses, it also played an important part in his formation at Regis Jesuit, and at Stanford thereafter.  \n“You don’t necessarily associate listening with high school students, but that’s when the Jesuit values really sank in for me,” he said. “Take the often-quoted creed Men and Women with and for Others. You can’t be for someone or something unless you understand their ambitions, their struggles, how they think and where they would like to go. To do that, you have to listen.” \n \nArmistead now lives in Los Altos, California, and Respond Software has been purchased by FireEye Inc. where Mike continues in an executive role. Across more than a thousand miles, he has heard the call of Inspire & Ignite 2025, Regis Jesuit’s vision for access, innovation and excellence—especially the goal of removing real and perceived barriers to entry and retention for students and families who desire to attend. He has responded wholeheartedly, with a significant financial aid gift in the name of the Armistead Family Endowed Scholarship. \n \n“If someone can’t go because of need, it’s a tragedy,” said Armistead, who worked during high school, including as a janitor, while playing football, basketball and running track. He also dabbled in speech and debate, worked backstage in the theatre program and was elected vice president of student government. He received significant financial aid to attend Stanford, where he majored in engineering and continued to work at various jobs to help pay for school expenses.  \n \nThe gift from Armistead and his wife Kathy will ensure that a student with financial need can experience what Mike says benefitted him the most: “the hard work and challenges required to excel at many things, along with the cross-group friendships and involvement in activities that cut across traditional stereotypes and cliques.”   \n \nHe said: “I gained a lot of confidence in those days, primarily by stretching beyond being ‘just an athlete’ or ‘just a good student.’ That’s what I’d like to enable in someone else.” \n \nThe Armistead family’s ties to Jesuit education—and to Regis Jesuit—remain strong. Mike’s three sons attended the all-male Bellarmine College Preparatory school in San Jose. His brother, Mark ’80 runs Regis Jesuit’s annual golf tournament, The Rudy Cup, which supports the Rudy Brada Scholarship for Financial Aid. Between Mark and their brother Matthew ’86, they count three more Raider alums: Joanna ’09, Greg ’06 and Colin ’19. Caroline will graduate in 2022.  \n \n“I grew up neither wealthy or poor and went to Catholic school. I saw my parents putting money in the collection plate every week; and I learned early on that giving back is incredibly important. Over the years, I’ve been the recipient of someone else’s generosity, and I include my Catholic educators as part of that.” \n \nArmistead knows that his family’s gift to Regis Jesuit will make a real difference. “When I look at the places I can support, I choose the ones that are most deserving and also will be the most appreciative. For me, Regis Jesuit certainly fits that criteria.” \nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

Through the summer swim team in Castle Pines, they knew Teddy ’15 and John ’17 Koerner, who went on to graduate from Pomona College and Columbia University respectively. And they knew about Jackson Fox ’13, another swimmer, who works as a consultant at Deloitte, after graduating from Notre Dame. \n\nFinancially, Regis Jesuit was an ambitious choice for the Tierneys, but thanks to financial aid, their boys were able to dive right in. As student-athletes dedicated to serving others, they’ve made quite the splash.\n“My parents met and saw some really high-achieving kids, so they had a great impression from the get-go,” said Ryan, now a second-year student at Harvard where he swims with the varsity team and is part of the Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corp (NROTC). “They value education above all else, and, as a Catholic family, we knew about the benefits of a Jesuit education. At Regis Jesuit, I learned to tackle issues from a lot of different angles. I learned to think critically.” He also continued his commitment to service, learned to improvise on the trumpet with the RJ Advanced Jazz Ensemble and graduated as valedictorian of the Boys Division in 2020. His valedictory speech, The Final Lesson, was defined in part by the impact of COVID on the senior class.\n\n“Self-sacrifice is the highest form of the human condition,” he shared. “We use it to lift others up… Right now, more than 80,000 people have died across the United States in the past three months from coronavirus. While much of this may be out of our control, through the sacrifice of our ‘senior sunset’ (which pales in comparison to the immense self-sacrifice of the healthcare workers in this country), we have been empowered to show love for our fellow humans and to prevent future casualties, even though we may never be aware of their existence.”\n\nRyan’s brother Matthew is now a senior at Regis Jesuit. He also considers service to be one of the most impactful parts of his high school experience, along with playing trombone in the jazz ensemble and being a member of the Diversity Action Group (DAG).\n\n“It was not only the things we did [in DAG], but I also made most of my closest friends there,” he says. Through his association with DAG, Matthew and 17 other RJ students and four adults attended the 65th annual meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of Women CSW65 in March of 2021. The theme was women's full and effective participation and decision-making in public life, as well as the elimination of violence, for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. \n\nMatthew says, “We listened to presentations from adult activists and commission leaders from all over the world. I took away that women’s rights mean different things in different places. Of course, I’m a white guy, but hopefully, our experience there, and our new awareness, encourages more people like me—especially at Regis Jesuit—to learn more and do more to make our school a more diverse and understanding place.” Matthew’s blog about the experience can be found online here.  \n\nThe Tierney boys’ father Patrick says, “Regis developed our sons morally, mentally and physically. As their understanding of their academic subjects matured, so did their understanding of God.”\n\nTheir mother Sarah agrees, sharing that she is “profoundly grateful” for the generous financial aid that made it possible for her family to experience the community and education that uniquely defines the school. “Thanks to the benevolence of the Regis community, our sons have benefited from an outstanding education and have developed lifelong friendships.”\nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

Eric Ramirez, SJ, RJ's Pastoral Director, shared Ignatius' incredible conversion story. Led by several theology teachers to Lou Kellogg Stadium, students then enjoyed a fun obstacle course and the launching of water balloons in Lou Kellogg Stadium at the school's suit of armor \"RJ Raider,\" attempting to hit it in the right leg in honor of St. Ignatius. Students also had the opportunity to make their own \"cannonballs\" by jumping in the pool.

Part of the reason the decision became so difficult for me is that I felt as if I had no closure from my high school experience at Regis Jesuit. Over the past four years, Regis has become a place of pure joy, growth and an enormity of love for me and for all the seniors of the Class of 2020. Leaving that behind was something I was not quite ready to do mid-March, and I was excited to celebrate our class’ time together those last few weeks to become ready. So, when the announcement came that we would not be returning to school, I was devastated. Four years of dancing the night away, laughing hysterically in the hallways, cheering with the greatest of pride during football games or before meets, bonding in an indescribable manner with one’s sisters and brothers on retreat, feeling love and belonging, was now practically finished. And I felt as if I never had a chance to say goodbye.\n\n\nI am utterly amazed at the strength and resilience of the Regis Jesuit community during quarantine, especially the faculty, staff and seniors. It has shown me God’s ability to bring consolation to moments that are so easily marked as times of desolation. The amount of joy the drive-thru, Microsoft Teams meetings, volunteer opportunities, daily prayers, counselor check-ins and small yet enormously impactful texts have brought me and all members of the community has outshone the darkness. They remind me of my gratitude toward all the experiences and people of Regis who have impacted my life eternally and the things I normally take for granted. I know that next time I hug a friend, I will take the time to truly appreciate the gift of their embrace and of their presence in my life. I know that I am forever thankful for the power and gift of words because they allow me to tell someone how beautiful they are and how much they mean to me. I know that when all of the RJ community can come fully together again, I will rejoice in the sisterhood and brotherhood of the community.\n\n\nAs the infamous Tony Stark of Marvel’s Avengers once stated, “Part of the journey is the end.” Though I have struggled to embrace this concept, what has given me more comfort is the fact that the journey is not just comprised of the end once it is over. It is made up of all those moments, good and bad, that made it so monumental. It is made up of the memories that will last us a lifetime and more, and it is made up of how we continue to be what we have learned to be from the journey itself long after it has ended. My time in the physics classroom has led me to pursue a path in medicinal physics. Being part of the cross country, track and swim teams has helped me decide to run in college. Kairos has allowed me to see that I am loved exactly for who I am, taught me how to love others and God more fully and convinced me that I am a leader. My teachers and peers in grades above or below me have shown me that meaningful relationships can look so different than I once imagined. This quarantine has proved to all of us our ability to lift each other out of the dark. The journey we have been on these past four years may be coming to a close, but the unexpected manner in which it does will not define what we take away from it.\n\n\n\nOver the past four years, Isalina has been part of Regis Jesuit’s Cross Country, Swim & Dive and Track & Field teams, as well as a member of the Fiat and Cadre Clubs. She will be attending the University of Notre Dame next fall where she plans to study physics into medicine.\n\n_______________\n\nTHE FINAL LESSON\nRyan Tierney ’20\n\n\nOn Thursday, March 12 at 2:45 pm, Regis Jesuit’s bell rang. Like any other day, it dismissed students and signaled the end of classes. But, on that particular day, things were different. Coronavirus took the United States by storm, the NBA suspended its season, CHSAA suspended all sports and activities and multiple school districts across the Denver metro area declared cancelations. During my AP Macroeconomics class, Mr. Tricco emailed the school and announced that we would not be returning that Friday. As the clock ticked down during the second half of class, everyone stood, watching the news from their iPads or phones. No one in that class, or throughout the school, was paying attention to their “final lesson.” The moment was surreal.\n\n\nIn hindsight, I suppose that last bell signaled a lot more than the end of the day. It signaled the end of four years for the senior class, the end of walks down the hall with friends, the end of sports and activities, the jeopardization of a normal conclusion to the senior experience. The final lesson, which marked the end of our time in high school, passed by without fanfare. For me, it was demoralizing, as it signified the abrupt conclusion to morning swim practices, Saturday team breakfasts and all the other parts of my final high school swim season. We at RJ are not alone. Across the country, hundreds of thousands of high school and college students have had the “pomp and circumstance” of their senior year robbed by COVID-19.\n\nFor four years, the Class of 2020 and I have grown immensely under the care and teaching of Regis Jesuit. Like at other high schools, we have grown in intellect. But a Raider education is rooted in care for the whole person, so we have also developed in our faith, in our commitment to the wellbeing of others and in our capacity to love. The “victory lap” for seniors—with prom, the senior book drop, yearbook signing and graduation—is a way for us to present that growth to the world. With this taken away, it can be easy to fall into despair and lamentation. It can be easy, on some level, to resent the scientists telling us that it is not safe to convene in public. It can be easy to grow irritated at public officials ordering us to stay home and away from school. It can even be easy to minimize the incredible risk that the virus poses to the elderly, those with pre-existing conditions and the general populace. Sadly, many high schools and students have fallen into this trap in recent days, especially with the gradual reduction of lockdown protocols across the country.\n\nBut what makes Regis special, and what, I believe, has allowed our school to avoid this trap, is that, at its core, the school imparts one value: self-sacrificial love. This love is demonstrated most in the dedication and care of the Regis Jesuit teachers, many of whom over four years have earned my utmost respect. However, in addition to them, the retreat program, Service Projects, theology curriculum and general world philosophy that guides all RJ activities is rooted in the idea that “if our brothers are oppressed, then we are oppressed” (Roosevelt), that “if they hunger, we hunger” (Roosevelt) and that if Jesus Christ could give his life on the cross for us, we can extend that love to our fellow humans.\n\nIt is this love to which we are all called. Of course, it can manifest itself in countless ways, from making yourself vulnerable to a loving spouse to serving the poor. No matter what form it takes, this love must be given wholeheartedly. Right now, more than 80,000 people have died across the United States in the past three months from coronavirus. While much of this may be out of our control, through the sacrifice of our “senior sunset” (which pales in comparison to the immense self-sacrifice of the healthcare workers in this country), we have been empowered to show love for our fellow humans and to prevent future casualties, even though we may never be aware of their existence.\n\nSo, while I wish that we could have had a normal end to this school year, one rich with celebration and closure, Regis Jesuit has prepared my classmates and me to be able to let that all go and be happy.\n\nThis was our final lesson.\n\n\nRyan has been involved in numerous clubs and activities during his time at Regis Jesuit, including the Boys Swim & Dive Team, National Honor Society, Mu Alpha Theta, Sports Analytics Club, RJ Media, Advanced Jazz Ensemble, the Rowdies and Cannonball Club. Next year, he will be attending Harvard University, where he will be swimming on the Men’s Swim and Dive Team and pursuing a career in the United States Navy through the Naval ROTC program.\nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

Since its inception 25 years ago, people from around the world have gathered to discuss the work being done to promote access to and participation of women and girls in education, training, science and technology, including the promotion of women’s equal access to full employment. \nSince 2014, Regis Jesuit has sent a delegation of students to participate in this impactful opportunity. Normally, we send 12 juniors and seniors with chaperones to New York City in March to take part. Because of the virtual nature of this year’s event, 18 current students and four adults were able to participate. Dylan Aquino ’22, Alejandro Casillas ’22, William Lanoha ’22, Luke MacPhee ’22, Samuel Opferman ’22, Joshua Smith ’22, Matthew Tierney ’22, Taylor Cipra ’22, Akon Edwang ’21, Greta Leege ’22, Kathryn Loftus ’22, Jordan Miller ’21, Lily O'Shaughnessy ’22, Elsa Pater ’22, Gwyneth Theobald ’22, Nzana Thillot ’21. Victoria Tuffour ’22 and Rylie Ward ’21 were joined by faculty members Ginger Brown, John Johnson, Mary Muldoon, Chris Vela for this year’s event. Delegate Matthew Tierney ’22 shared his thoughts on the experience.\n\nLearn more about RJ’s effort to gain Consultative Status with the United Nations\n\nOn Our Experience at CSW\nBy Matthew Tierney ’22\n\n\nGoing into the United Nations’ Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), I was excited to see how the international perspectives on women’s issues might overlap with the issues we students are confronted within a high school setting. Despite the limitations placed on our group by coronavirus-related circumstances (we had to attend the presentations online), we walked away with a wealth of knowledge on international women’s issues and the struggle to eliminate them, as well as a greater sense of solidarity and appreciation for activists in several different countries.\n\n\nWhile it was interesting learning about the unique problems women face around the world, like child marriage, the most powerful presentations were often those transcending geography. For instance, CSW forced us to confront head-on the gendered manifestations of digital violence regardless of location. Digital harassment, violence and exploitation are burgeoning issues, and multiple CSW presenters stressed the difficulty of enforcing laws online.\n\nMany members of our group, myself included, also sat in on presentations that dealt with the intersection of women’s issues and labor. We learned from labor activists and researchers of the exacerbated exploitation that women, particularly those in the global south, face at the workplace. One such presentation focused on the working conditions fueling the fast fashion industry, one that, as high school students and Americans, we are often on the consuming end of. Fueled by a hyper-exploited workforce largely in southern countries like Bangladesh, this industry is a perfect example of this intersection of women’s and labor issues. I was struck by the poignancy of this convergence in the presenter’s description of the 2013 Dhaka Garment Factory collapse that occurred after a largely female workforce’s concerns over worker safety went ignored, resulting in an industrial disaster and loss of human life that dwarfs the infamous Triangle Shirtwaist Fire of 1911.\n\n\nBetween presentations, our group held fruitful conversations about the issues that had been presented; specifically, we discussed how we could incorporate knowledge from the CSW into our own community at Regis Jesuit. On digital violence particularly, we felt that we could do more as a school combating it through education. We recognized that direct engagement with topics like sexual harassment that in past years might have been covered through the advisement program or assemblies had to be tabled given the circumstances of the pandemic. So, we brainstormed ways to strengthen education on issues of sexism at Regis Jesuit.\n\n\nBeyond changes on the school level, as students, our crucial takeaway from this experience is the idea that we all have a responsibility to work towards a more just society when it comes to women. As a middle-class American, and, in my case, as a man, I am often sheltered from the worst symptoms of the global situation that I, in many ways, benefit from. At CSW, however, I was exposed, albeit in a detached, academic setting, to the struggles of women around the globe. I also encountered a multitude of wonderful and dedicated people committed to making things better. After we had attended the CSW virtual presentations, we had the privilege of meeting directly with the United States' U.N. Youth Observer, Dustin Liu. He encouraged us to “imagine the world you want.” \n\n\nThe CSW made it powerfully clear that we all have a responsibility and the right to imagine a better world, and the responsibility for creating that world rests on all of us.\nBack\n  \nMatthew Tierney '22\nMatthew Tierney '22\nback\nnext",

We could literally see this family through the peepholes in the wall (we also saw their adorable little boy running around). At the end of the service, we put our hands up on the wall and sent our prayers to all the immigrants waiting to cross. It was incredible that the Regis group along with many others experienced this powerful moment at the same time. It was truly breathtaking.\nOur morning started with a nice walk to La Estrella Del Mar Catholic Parish after a wonderful breakfast. The service was a unique experience for us as it was presented through an entertaining Spanish puppet show (which was oriented towards the children of the parish). Then, we headed to Friendship Garden for the binational church service. We had a sunny afternoon with ocean breezes here in Tijuana, so the garden was bustling. While we were waiting for the services to begin, many of us talked to people strolling through the garden and conducted a few interviews. During the service- which was shared with people participating on the California side of the border via live streaming- we heard Matthew 15:13-16. John and Kaeyla helped distribute communion.\n\nAfter the two services, we got on a bus and zipped off to Mercado Hidalgo. At the market, we all looked around and bought souvenirs and a lot of candy. We then went to the Tijuana cultural center. We learned all about the history of the Californias (Baja California, Baja California Sur, and California) including its Indigenous people. We also discovered that the Jesuits popped up a few times in its history! We then went back to our condos and had a wonderful dinner made by the amazing chefs, Leon and Cara, who we had to say goodbye to. We ended the night with final reflections, examen, and a chaotic sandwich assembly line (where we prepared sandwiches to offer to those in need).\nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

We were gathered to watch them perform traditional dances to celebrate various parts of their lives. After finishing two dances, they invited us to join in for the third. We gathered around an oak tree and followed their steps, swaying from side to side and following closely in a line. We laughed with them, or rather they laughed at our lack of rhythm. Either way, it bonded us together. \nToday, we ate an amazing breakfast prepared by a couple who own a local restaurant. After, we journeyed to the Cultural Center of Kumeyaay Indigenous People. There we learned all about their culture. We were blessed with sage and a traditional song. Then, we learned about herbs used in their culture by taking a walk around their land. We ate a traditional meal consisting of acorn, beans, lentils, and corn. The lunch following was even more phenomenal with a variety of options at a buffet. \nAfter we returned from the Cultural Center, we were graced with dinner. After we finished, we had a very interesting conversation with Lacey, an immigration lawyer. We learned a lot about what she does, and the people she’s encountered in her job. We were able to film her answers to our numerous questions about her day-to-day life, encounters during her free legal consults, and the immigration process in general. She told us that what gives her hope to change the cold and cruel immigration system is us, the next generation. If we advocate for what we believe and for the marginalized, real change will be put in to place. We learned that we truly have the power to change the world one conversation at a time. \nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

When we woke up we went to the garden at the Wall in Friendship Park and had a really great time. It was a chance to connect with nature and learning about the binational garden was extremely impactful. Working with native plants and learning about the ecosystems was incredible. One of the most impactful moments was when Dan, an American who now lives in TJ and works in the Friendship Park garden, was arguing with Border Patrol about the wall. Next week there is a plan in place to build a 30 foot wall where the current wall is in place. Dan was explaining how badly it would destroy the ecosystems and the natural plant life already living there.\n\n\nAt lunch we had the opportunity to explore on our own, try the different street food, and meet and interview many people. After lunch we met with Effran Gonzales, an advocate for immigrants and refugees. We had the opportunity to talk with him and learn about all the immigrants coming into Tijuana. We learned that Mexico actually houses a lot of immigrants from all over Southern America.\n\n\nThe most impactful part of today was our conversation with Renaldo, a man who fled Honduras as an eleven year-old after members of his family were murdered. It was such an emotional and heart-warming talk. It is hard to believe how much one person has been through.

This area had been promised to the Chicano community as a park to make amends for the loss of access to the beach because of Naval installations and further degradation of the area due to highway construction. However, in 1969, construction began on a state highway patrol station. This development galvanized Chicano activists and residents of Barrio Logan. As they protested the demanded space for their own to use, the resulting land located under the highway bridges became what is now known as Chicano Park-a Mecca of Chicano art in the San Diego areas. Many of the most prominent murals recognize Latino and Chicano heroes, important historical events, and community members. \nOne of our guides, Wes, told us about the low rider community in southern California, as we looked at a new mural that stretched between two sides of a concrete pillar. The mural was painted using air brushes, just like low rider cars are painted. This mural showed the historical significance of low rider culture in southern California and reaffirmed the importance of commemoration and the recognition of art in Chicano culture. As we stood in the park, many of us reflected on their own experiences in school learning about some of the important people who were depicted in the murals, such as Frida Kayla, Diego Rivera, César Chavez, and Corky Gonzales.\nAs we crossed the border into Mexico it was significant enough for us to realize the disparity between both sides of the border walls-the San Diego side houses were all pushed back miles from the border, where in Tijuana, you could see over the wall from a three story building. Large stretches of the wall, in spite of unfavorable painting conditions, display vast murals recognizing the friendship between the United States and Mexico, and also the inhumanity of the border wall. Through the slated fence we saw border patrol agents and the flooded marshes of southern San Diego, but on the Mexico side we saw busy city centers and many monuments with hearts as a common motif. In our reflection back in the condo many of us recognized not only the differences between life on the San Diego border vs the Tijuana border, but also the differences in food, people, and music, when only one mile away life is so different. \nBack\n  \nPhoto by Andrew Massie '23\nPhoto by Andrew Massie '23\nback\nnext",

We had a seamless check-in process and got through security in record time. We all checked that our gate existed and then went off to grab a bite before the plane boarded. The plane boarded at 11 and took off shortly after. The flight landed at 1 o’clock California time. We met our partners from Peace Works travels at the airport and headed to the hotel. After dropping off our bags and freshening up we left to go get some lunch in Old Town San Diego.\nWe hopped into two vans and went about two miles down the road and got lunch at a local restaurant. We had a delicious meal of beans, tortillas, and fajita chicken and beef. After eating our fill and saying goodbye to the staff, we headed back to the hotel to prepare for our first reflection, this time on foot. Walking through Old Town was a good way to work off some of the food we ate at lunch and get a feel for the neighborhood. We saw plenty of interesting stores, the oldest cemetery in San Diego, and some historic buildings.\n\nThen, we had our first team meeting on the trip after lunch. Not only did we start to really get comfortable being around each other we also learned and refined many skills. One of the first things we did was play this rhythm game where one person stands in the middle of a circle while everyone around them is doing some random action. A selected person changes it every once and a while and the person in the middle has to guess who is changing. After a few rounds of this and another ice-breaker, we started to talk about entering and being in Tijuana. We also did an interview exercise where we got to know each other but also to practice our listening skills. We each paired up with someone we don’t know well and worked on authentic listening and showing empathy to someone’s story. We asked how each of us are feeling about the trip. We also got a chance to really get to know the person we were interviewing and become a lot closer as a group. \nAfter this fun meeting, we set out for dinner at a nice Italian restaurant where we had some pizza and salad. Having dinner after a long day of moving around felt great. One of us even fell asleep. We stopped by and got some ice cream on the way back. We also helped a nice young lady to park her car. Sadly one of our members lost his phone, which made our trek home a bit longer. We all are both excited and anxious to go into Tijuana tomorrow.\nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

The adults surprised the group with a trip to the Bass Pro pyramid (we all loved it!), and then we divided our cooking and cleaning responsibilities to serve one more meal at Room in the Inn. We're in the sacred space of wanting to go home, but also not wanting to leave.\nA reflection from John Reasbeck\nWow. The last day and here I am watching all my new friends clean our basement bunker while I get to type away. This morning 3 of us got a 7:15 wake up call, and I got to enjoy a nice trip to the Manna House. I had 0 clue what to expect walking into this beautiful place, but I was in for a great morning. Manna house provides coffee and clothing for those in need of it, but most of all a friendly and warm smile. I got to converse with some neighbors who all have very unique perspectives on life, no matter how old or young they may be. Some neighbors struggle more then others, but through all of that, I noticed that Manna house seemed to provide a way to help boost a poor mood to a good one. I got the chance to develop new relationships and immerse myself in what a day might look like for someone else. This opportunity opened my eyes and gave me perspectives that I have never thought of before. Being able to provide warmth with a hot cup of coffee or a conversation was so meaningful to a lot of people but especially myself because of those reasons. Places like Manna house are truly a light in a community struggling with darkness and it truly shows in the work that the workers and volunteers do. I recognized how much time and effort goes into every detail and it’s really amazing that people sacrifice themselves for the well-being of others, and to bear weight that those struggling may be dealing with. Every day in Memphis has been so eye opening, but I’m so fortunate to be able to get the chance to give my gifts to Manna House. \n\n\nA reflection from Jacob Simpson\nToday has been a day we have had before but still makes the same impact no matter how many times you experience it. The feeling of joy when you are able to help someone that has asked for help and you were able to give without question or thought is amazing. Today we worked in the kitchen at Room in the Inn, and I was able to help those people in need there. We worked to prepare the food, arriving earlier than guests to make sure they were able to just sit down and enjoy. Side note: they make a big emphasis on saying guest and not customers. Something I think makes the guest feel more at home and welcome. Anyways I was working throughout the late afternoon to make the beans that were going to be served alongside the other thing that tacos are comprised of. After the meal was ready, I helped to serve and bring out the food to the guests. On one of my trips to some of the more longtime guests at the inn I found a man looking a tad bit lost and carrying a coffee. I approached the man asking how he was doing. He responded saying he was heading back to his room and was just trying to find it. I walked with him through the hallways talking about how he had lived in California and had to move because he couldn’t afford to live there. He had been in Memphis for about a year now and was just having a hard time finding a job because of his age. We eventually made it back to the room and he said thank you for talking with him and the most people he meets that didn’t really want to hear what his story was.\n \n \nA reflection from Ben Scharbach\nToday three of us woke up early to immerse ourselves in a fun day at Manna House. At first I felt uncomfortable but then slowly got the hang of it. I was separated from the group and went to assist the guests with their showers. I would assist them by  exchanging their clothes for new ones. While doing that I started making conversations with the guests and really got to understand their situation and why they are stuck there. I would ask many questions and make personal connections with them. While listening to the guests, I would see the emotions flow with their words and really understand them and their situations. At the end of my time there I went outside and really saw how great of a community it is there. Everyone’s problems were different, but at the end they were all sharing coffee and stories and really being a community. Seeing this made me conscious that no matter how difficult life can get, creating a safe space will bring a sense of peace and comfort.\n \n \nA reflection from Ethan Gremmert\n“So, you guys going to college?” A short silence was followed by people around the table casually saying, “Yes.” I waited, sat there, and then eventually followed the crowd with my own, “Yea.” As I think now, I wonder why I paused. The kid was only in the eighth grade, and I sat there, a twelfth grader, disoriented by a question about my future. It was a question that I would have casually responded to if I was talking to one of my mom’s friends or a relative, but at this moment I did not. I had waited, but for what? Because the question caught me off guard? Because I thought everyone else would start answering? No, I think I paused because I felt uncomfortable. Not with the question, but with the thoughts that the kid I was talking to might never get the chances we had. College seems like such an inevitable occurrence to me, but in that moment, I felt it was different for him. It seemed as if he had so much curiosity and, at that moment, I was struck. The ideas of privilege and opportunity have constantly floated around my mind on this trip. Experiencing and interacting with people who are experiencing homelessness and poverty along with seeing those who are being helped by organizations and groups has shown me my privilege and other’s suffering. I had felt emotions like this before when doing service or seeing a person experiencing homelessness in Colorado, but throughout this trip, they have been magnified. Somehow, I feel that my experience here has been more impactful and transformative for me than in the past. Before coming and seeing Memphis, the first thoughts I had about it either involved the Grizzlies or barbeque, but now I see a great community. It may be struggling, but I feel that we have made a real impact for many people. It's definitely made an impact on me.\n \nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

After packing 6,000lbs of food, our grand total for the past two days went up to 10,000lbs of food sorted and packaged to be given to the community. One thing that has struck me from our time there is how grateful Jeremy, the Volunteer Coordinator, was for our help. Every person we have encountered has gone above and beyond in expressing their gratitude towards the time and effort we dedicated to immersing ourselves in the Memphis community and helping some of the people in it. We continued our day at Neighborhood Christian Center and every employee there continued the theme of gratitude. Every “thank you” has gone beyond the surface level of being polite. It’s obvious that those words were deeply heartfelt and genuine. It has served as a reminder that the little things always count and things that may seem insignificant to some have the power to change the lives of others.\n\n\nA reflection from Carly Kennedy\n\nAfter finishing lunch we headed off to the Neighborhood Christian Center to help create pieces for their Switzerland travel experience. This organization makes models of different countries for kids in the Memphis area to “travel” to.  When we first arrived, they presented a video to us, showing one of their previous set-ups.  The video was super cool to watch because the amount of thought that goes into every aspect of this project is insane.  In the past they have created several life-like areas such as an airport, an airplane, hotels, and many other features to replicate what a real trip going out of the country looks like.  During the short amount of time that we volunteered there, I recognized how much time and effort goes into every detail.  A few of us were assigned to help make tiny houses that would be placed in one of the backgrounds, which was very fun but also time consuming. We only made a small impact of the Neighborhood Christian Center’s complete goal, but it was cool to be a part of the amazing experience and memories they are making for these kids. \n\n\nA reflection from Gabbie Contos\nWe were going to have Mexican food for lunch. I was jazzed. Pete, the founder of Manna House, brought us to this little side restaurant and bought me and my classmates a buffet of rice and beans and pork and chips and other stuff. We ate a delicious meal, but then Pete stood up to talk to us. He explained the history of his organization, the Manna House. It was created to be a safe haven for those experiencing poverty and possibly homelessness. It is a place to hangout, get coffee, and take a warm shower while being provided with a fresh pair of clothes.  He ended his talk telling us that people always ask how they can get involved with his organization. He answers them by saying that they should start their own. If one organization gets too big, it gets harder to become hospitable. It is easy to be hospitable as an individual or small group.

None of us are Picasso, but we divided into groups and partook in different crafts to fabricate a Switzerland like world. Although this was not what we were expecting to do today, the people at Christian Community Center could not have been more kind and welcoming.

We're feeling the middle-ness of the trip: tired, connected, a little homesick mixed with still longing to be here.\nA reflection from Chloe Hills\nToday, I woke up earlier than everyone else in preparation for a short yet demanding day. I showered and found time for myself, getting ready to give others my undivided attention in an urgent time of need. When everyone was awake and ready for the day, we went to the food bank. There, we met a passionate man eager for volunteers to help feed people in difficult situations. He was a willing and kind man, prepared to give his time and attention to the ones who urgently need. After we worked there for a few hours, we went for a picnic at the base of a bridge, connecting Arkansas to Tennessee. We ate and then started on our way to Arkansas. When we were halfway through our walk, we partnered up with someone who we hadn’t had much experience with. I was partnered with Ethan, a kind and introverted young man. He and I talked about our experience with the trip, but also our lives outside of school. We found out we both got into the same college we are both considering. It was nice finding a new perspective after knowing some of the other kids on the trip for years. After that we went to a shelter called the Room In the Inn and made dinner. It was a frustrating night of cooking for many, with different dynamics in the kitchen, however we got through it and ultimately fed everyone. We learned to work together. Then, we all went to our bunker and spent time reflecting on ourselves and emotions, and played games together.\n\nReflection from Ava Rogala\n\nAfter waking up and eating breakfast on our third day in Memphis, we made our way to a food bank. I was initially excited because I have always loved working in food banks. It is such a great way to support the community and help our problem of hunger and food waste. At the end, the man who helped us throughout our time there told us that we packed over 4,000 pounds of food. This was an amazing, fulfilling feeling to know that we helped so many hungry people. This specific work that we did was very touching to me. Two hours out of our day can bring health and happiness to a great amount of people and families. I saw God in this work through all of the love and happiness we had throughout the day. Music was playing and people were dancing and laughing while also working hard to help the people in the community. I am excited for all the other work we are going to do on this trip.\n\n\nA reflection from Libby Roe\nToday was a busy day! We slept in until 8:40 because no one woke us up. Then, we ate breakfast and headed to the food bank to get to work. Of course I had to box all the cereals and it took a lot of man power! After our lovely workout at the food bank, we had a picnic on the sidewalk, and then walked 3 miles to Arkansas!! It was a fun walk with a cool view of the Mississippi River. After our walk we came back to the bunker and had some down time. But Anne, Ben, Ava, Jacob, Ms. Brown, and I all went on our second shopping trip to Kroger. We got extra food for the dinner we were going to prepare for the guests at the Room in the Inn. It was a night of hard work and lots of different smells, but the guests enjoyed the meal! After a few ours of making dinner, cleaning, and serving, we headed back to the bunker for reflection and family friendly games.\n\n\nA reflection from Annie Brown\nToday was a very long, but fulfilling day. We started our morning with a later start which was a great surprise then headed to a food bank! We split up into 3 groups and by the end we had packed over 4,000 pounds of food. It was probably my favorite service activity and I’m excited to go back tomorrow. We then headed to a bridge crossing the Mississippi river. We walked all the way to Arkansas!!! We headed back to the bunkhouse and took a quick power nap. A group of us went to Kroger to grab some last minute ingredients for dinner and other snacks we have  ALREADY run out of. We met the rest of the group back at Room in the Inn to cook a spaghetti dinner for all of the guests. Cooking with 23 people in a small kitchen is not for the weak. Our patience was tested, but we worked hard and ended with a yummy dinner. We ended our day with a reflection and some games!\n\nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

We loved being in the community today and working alongside and for our Memphis neighbors. We ate lunch together and then headed to the National Civil Rights Museum. We finished the evening with local BBQ soul food and a walk down historic Beale Street. What a day!\nA reflection from Eva Halker\nToday, I felt very surprised at the Manna house with the community that was built and how the community welcomed us. Antonio, a nice young man using the Manna house to take a shower, was surprised that we were from Colorado and made a point to welcome us to Memphis and thank us for the service we are doing for the city. It was encouraging to see first-hand the people we were helping and the impact (big or small) that we had to help their day run a little smoother. We worked with regular volunteers and listened to their stories of Memphis and saw the relationships that they had made with the people they help. I was impressed by the respect that the guests have for the Manna house because of the importance that it holds in their lives and the help that they receive every week from them. We then went to the Civil Rights Museum and many of us were overwhelmed by the brutality shown towards humans. We learned and experienced the sight of Dr. Martin Luther King’s execution at the Lorraine Motel. I was inspired by a lady who used to live in the motel who now protests every day on the street for what she believes in. Finally, I found joy in the culture of Memphis, walking down Beale Street and taking in the bright street signs and exciting atmosphere. After our tiring dance party to a local jazz band, we were surprised by delicious cookies.\n\n\nA reflection Karl-Emery Angbanzan\nToday was a very enriching day filled with culture, joy, and companionship among us and the community of Memphis. We started the day at Room In the Inn where we learned about the Inn and also cleaned some of the rooms. The mission and purpose of the organization is very inspiring and pays homage to the strong community of Memphis. My favorite part of the day (and probably the entire trip) was the National Civil Rights Museum. There was a certain feeling that was amplified by the scenes which depicted where Dr. Martin Luther King was shot and killed. I loved the integration of the motel and the museum as it made the experience feel very surreal as I was walking on the grounds of what once was the center of a truly horrific site. Seeing that my classmates were just as much awe as I was further affirmed the feeling.  We ended the night with a stroll through downtown Memphis and it was a site to see. We were introduced to a little spot where a band was playing live music and let me tell you…..IT WAS A PARTY.  The pure joy and community in the moment is something I’ll never forget for the rest of my life.\n\n\n\nA reflection from Amery Galan\nToday was an incredible day filled with learning, laughter, love, and building relationships. I started my day at the Manna house and at first the group and I were feeling anxious. We didn’t know how the community would feel about us coming into volunteer. Shortly after our arrival we heard a man yell excitedly, “ Hey look new volunteers!” We helped around the Manna house serving coffee, getting clothes to people, and just talking with the guests. What surprised me most about working with the people in the Manna house, was their resilience and bright outlook on life. Even though they didn’t have much they were happy to be there and to be with us. After lunch we went to the National Civil Rights Museum which was truly a learning opportunity for the class. It was as if we went back in time when we walked up to the museum because the Lorraine Motel where Martin Luther King jr. was assassinated was the front of the building. Everyone has seen images of the Lorraine motel, but to be there and see where MLK died gave lots of us chills. The museum was amazing but also terribly sad. To end the night, we all went on a stroll down Beale street. We stopped to dance to the amazing live music of the real deal cowboy Neal. It was an incredible way to end the day, by dancing, singing, and laughing with all my classmates.\n\n\n\nA reflection from Renee Sobania\nOn our second day in Memphis we were able to start our service to the Memphis community and learn more about the history of the city. Our morning started at a place called Room In The Inn. We met with Terri, the volunteer coordinator. She gave us a bit of background about the organization. She explained that the building used to be a hospital which was transformed into a place for people or families who needed a place to stay in order to get off the streets. This hospital used to be one of the only hospitals that accepted black patients or allowed black doctors to work. This organization really wanted to keep the history of the hospital alive and honor its service by keeping the original structure and design of the building. Another great thing about Room In The Inn is they truly focus on helping the families and people there. They have two floors with two separate sections. One section of the building was for families and the other section was for guests from recuperative care. I loved that they only accepted a few guests at a time so that they were able to find a more permanent location to live, or so the recuperative care patients had enough time to recover so they could care for themselves. While they take fewer guests, they try their best to ensure that they have time to get back on their feet so they can stay off the streets. After Terri talked to us, half of us worked to clean up the kitchen and dining area while the other half went to clean up a room for two new families. While this job didn’t seem like much to us, this small act of cleaning a room or mopping a floor,  will allow for a new family to move into a nice clean room and for the guests to enjoy their meal in a clean dining area. The next part of our day we ventured to the Civil Rights Museum. This was probably one of the coolest museums I have ever been to. We were able to see the exact location that Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated at the Lorraine Motel. They had completely transformed the hotel into a beautiful museum which showed the many years of oppression, slavery, and discrimination that African American people have experienced for centuries. We were also able to see the spot where MLKs assassin stood when he shot him. I thought this was an incredible museum and I encourage anyone who travels to Memphis to visit. After the museum we headed back to the bunker and had some of the best BBQ I have ever had. After our reflection we went out onto Beale Street. While it was a Monday night and not very busy we had a great time singing and dancing to a live Jazz band called The Real Deal Cowboy Neal. This was the highlight of my trip so far and I can’t wait for what else is to come in Memphis.\nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

Every small win leads to a greater impact, and it's all about living in those moments and learning along the way.\nColin Beatty – Today was finally Friday, which was very exciting. Not because it’s the end of the week, but because of how we got to end our day out: a dance party. I’d been anticipating this for a couple of days. Every Friday, the clients get a whole 45 minutes to sing and dance to any songs of their choosing, ranging from “Thriller” by Michael Jackson to “Smooth Criminal” by Michael Jackson. Honestly it really just consisted of a lot of Michael Jackson, which is not a complaint by any means. The staff would find the music video on YouTube, and everyone would get up and dance. There was no order to anything and everyone danced however they wanted to, and it was really fun. One guy would be swaying, one lady would be jumping, another would be doing the Macarena, and some other guy would be reenacting Pigpen from the Peanuts. It was complete and utter chaos, and yet it was still immensely fun. Everyone was just enjoying what they were doing right before their weekend. It was the perfect way to close off a magnificent week, and I look forward to the next dance party (where there will hopefully be some more MJ).\n \nStarnia Bleus – Prior to coming to HighPointe, I had never encountered adults with intellectual/developmental disabilities and had no idea what I was getting myself into. My first few days, I was completely lost and felt like a hinderance in the classroom. I just stood there for 6 back-breaking hours in the teacher’s way as they attended to their clients. I was assigned to the foundation group, which is filled with nonverbal adults that need more “hands-on” care. Due to the clients being nonverbal, finding ways to communicate with them was difficult; however, at the end of the week, I started to pick up on their silent communication. Today, I was paired with K, who is a quadriplegic and nonverbal. He has the most amazing smile and can shake his head side to side which you need to infer if he means yes or no. Today, I was trying to make him choose between two books and he kept smiling and shaking his head and I just couldn't figure out which one he preferred, but there was this moment were he looked me directly in the eye and I just understood what he meant. I can’t wait for more genuine eye contact next week alongside more smiling.\n \nEm Fischer- After hearing the stories from other people who also volunteered at the Tennyson Center, I realized that even though I am volunteering at the same place, I have had a very different experience. I have been working in the Highschool Aspen Classroom. There are 7 children, 6 of whom are on the spectrum for autism and 1 who has a TBI (Traumatic Brain injury.) I have worked with similar children before so I came into this immersion with confidence and knew what I was going to face. This whole past week had been pretty peaceful as I learned about the students as well as grew closer to the teachers. One student was very quiet and always walked around with his hood on. I noticed his desk was covered in hamster stickers, and it seemed a little unlike him. I asked one of the teachers about why his desk was just coated in cute, big eyed hamster stickers, and she explained to me that, when he first came into the site, he didn’t let anyone near him. He was very violent and would start fights whenever a teacher approached him. As time passed, he started to warm up, and every time a teacher could approach his desk, they would put a sticker on his desk. One thing she said really stood out to me: “It’s the small wins that count.” She made me realize that, even though during these weeks I wouldn’t witness any big changes, many of these children have improved so much over time. Most of the students that started have improved so much, whether it was in behavior or it was in being calm, they all improved greatly, and it gave me a new perspective. I may not make a big impact, but I might help make some “small wins.”\nBack\n  \nEm, Star, and Colin relax after Day 5\nEm, Star, and Colin relax after Day 5\nEm, Star, and Colin relax after Day 5\nback\nnext",

Today was also Maddy's fourth day at HighPointe. Bo and Brenna both continued working in their assigned classrooms at Tennyson Center while Maddy continued to make connections with the clients in room two. \nBrenna Albrecht '23:\n\nThis was my fourth day working at the Tennyson Center in the elementary classroom. There are about eight students in my class, and I have tried to get to know all of them more and more each day. It's an all boys class so I've been staying on my toes. The energy of the classroom today felt a bit lower, it is Thursday after all! We started the morning by doing our routine \"movement\" which consists of dancing along to Kidz Bop and participating in small workouts. We continued by doing math centers, and I got to play the card game Garbage with most of the kids. Other highlights from the morning included playing computer games with student D and playing Hot Wheels zombie invasion with student J. Things began to go downhill when we all went to the gym to play a game for group therapy. Unfortunately, 8-10 year old boys are extremely competitive and struggle with the idea of anything else besides winning. Things escalated very quickly, and the class dynamic shifted almost immediately. Kids ended up crying, more staff had to be called, and I felt out of place. I wanted to help in anyway I could, but I didn't know how. This feeling of awkwardness has been a sort of an ongoing feeling, and I truly don't think it will ever go away. As I experience more and more, I am learning to let go of my power and knowing. I'm working on being able to just go with the flow and be more open to feeling uncomfortable. I am excited to continue to learn and be pushed out of my comfort zone during the rest of my days at Tennyson.\n \nBo Blount ’23\n\n\nI have truly been changed through my time at Tennyson center in the middle school classroom. After my fourth day it doesn’t feel like I am doing service, and more feels like I am just helping my friends. I have made relationships and friendships I will never forget about. Sometimes it really feels like they are helping me more than I help them. I have learned patience, responsibility and many more through my conversations and games with the students. Hopefully the students look at me as a role model and someone they can trust and talk to.\n \nMaddy Rose ’23\n \nDuring my fourth day at High Pointe I was able to interview five different clients about their different disabilities and how they interact with the world. All five clients talked about how many people assume that they are unable to make their own decisions and live a happy and healthy life. However, a handful of clients live in their own apartments and travel by themselves and those who live a host home and have caretakers have a variety of hobbies and personal interests that they engage in. They all have the same rights as any other adult and should be respected and treated as such. I found it very insightful to learn about the more legal side of the clients’ disabilities and how they are informed of the importance of their human rights. Along with the interviews I helped with arts and crafts. I had many fun conversations with the clients about their family and the upcoming paly and talent show they are going to put on. I look forward to what talents they are going to perform next week. I’m excited to be returning tomorrow.\nBack\n  ",

Now at the half way mark for this fully immersed week, they also share how they have adjusted and fit in not only at the shared Airbnb, but in each of the kid's and staff's everyday schedule.\nWinnie Eller- On the first day at the Tennyson Center for Children, I was assigned to work with middle school boys with mental and/or learning disabilities, and I'll say that I was not the most excited person in the world to work with them. I walked into classroom 206 and was greeted with several staff members and only 2 kids in the room. Most of the day I sat back and observed so I could get a grasps of the schedule and what rules were in place, but I was able to make some quick connections and conversations with a few of the student as the day went on. The second day I was hit with the harsh reality of what this class was going to be like, arguments and rude comments, up in the air schedules and watching multiple movies a day, but I was hopeful for what was to come since I got to meet more students and play games with each of them. Today was the first with no crazy events, and I probably spent about 4 hours in total playing a math pizzeria game with the students, answering about 95% of those math questions. However, the most impactful part of this experience so far has been that the class of 206 has been known to be a \"handful\" in the nicest way possible, and that their reputation has turned away many volunteers, but so far the children in class 206 have been well behaved 95% of the time, and are usually willing to do they work that needs to be done. I've gotten to experience first hand the difference between reputation and actuality, and it has opened me to changing my perspective on other groups as well. These past 3 days have made me really hopeful for the next week and a half, and I can't wait to get to know both the students and staff members of the Tennyson Center even better. \n\nJovany Espinoza- Arriving the week of immersions I had no idea of what to expect, but right as I took my first step into the class I felt unknown, I had no clue what would come from me and and those around.  While I was sitting in the back of the class I was waiting for the right opportunity to get myself into the rhythm of the class, but at times the right opportunity never comes but the unexpected does. I soon see a little kid start to turn around slowly, and as soon as we made eye contact he gives me the simplest gesture, a nod. Right then and there I felt noticed and even though I was in the back of the room I acknowledged the energy of every single person in the class. At times many people overthink about being liked or wondering what those around are thinking, but from my experience it is never about fitting in, but about being accepted for who you are. Day 4 has been completed and I have turned my focus on those around me, and now almost a whole week with people who I can honestly call friends has made me come to a conclusion. Friendships are not about who you have known the longest, they're about about those who walk into your life unexpectedly and say, \"I am here for you.\" It took me a long time to know what real friends are worth and I can say this experience has done nothing but good to me, hoping that the job I am doing now can go a long way and change those around me. \n\nJosiah Harris- Coming into Tennyson I truly didn't know what to expect, I was nervous. I didn't know how the children in the classroom would react to two random people suddenly come into their classroom for two weeks. My first day I didn't know what I could do to help around the classroom, I didn't know any of the students, and I hardly spoke to any of the staff members. Towards the end of the day on Monday I kindly asked a student if they would like to play Connect 4 with me, I noticed that it was their free time and he wasn't up to anything at all. After being beat consistently for about 20 minutes, this student and I found a way to connect through video games. We talked about what games we liked and didn't like and what our favorite gaming device was. On the second day the class spent a lot of time in the gym. I was able to really fit in with the class when we all played basketball and football together. The class is full of boys so sports was a great way for all of us to connect, but as far as the two girls in the class there weren't many ways for us to connect. Finally on the third day I found out that one of the girl students and I both really enjoy an artist named J Coles music. We talked a lot about what our favorite songs were by him, and other projects that he's made. \"Fitting in\" was never really a problem for me as a student, when I was younger I was very shy and quiet, but here at Tennyson I had to be quite the opposite, I have to be open to being able to reach out to others before they reach out to me.\nBack\n  \nThe Denver Immersion crew goes bowling\nJovany, Josiah, and Winnie at the house\nThe Denver Immersion crew goes bowling\nJovany, Josiah, and Winnie at the house\nback\nnext",

We were in separate rooms ranging from adults who are very independent to others who are very involved. Caley was in the enrichment room where the clients are pretty much independent and can be on their own. Sawyer was in the Fundamentals room with clients who are much more involved. We were able to interact much more with clients today and make some more in depth connections.\nCaley Walsh '23:\n\nToday was my second day at HighPointe. I sat next to a chatty woman I will call E. E brought up all sorts of topics during class when we were supposed to be listening. She told me about her love life, her dog, and just about everything. E told me that I felt like an older sister to her even though she was 27.  She was very sweet and spoke to about every client in the center. I met another woman in a wheelchair I will call K. I walked up to K because I had seen her looking around sitting quietly alone. She spoke with a very soft gentle tone. Later at lunch she called me over. She had ask me if I like eggnog (which I do not) and showed me recipes from magazines. She read to me the ingredients and excitedly showed me pictures of her pets. She made me feel very at ease. She was quiet but enjoyed speaking to us. I realized that sometimes I am going to have to push myself to start a conversation with someone. You will never know what it will mean to them or you. It also had a big impact on me that she remembered my name. That is a very small thing but often times when people ask for your name they will not care enough to really remember who you are. However, most of the clients at HighPointe only need to ask for your name once and they will say it and remember it every time you speak to them. I found this really brought me joy because it made me feel actually worth remembering. The last impactful memory I will share of this day was when my pal, B., who I had met yesterday came back from her outing. When she saw me her face lit up and she smiled, threw her hands up in the air and came over to me. The best part about this was that I was just as excited to see her. The connections these people are able to make with others in such a short amount of time is incredible. It has only been two days and these people have already made impactful memories that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.\n\nSawyer McFarland '23:\n\nI have just completed my second day at HighPonte. This week I am in the fundamental room and have been interacting with clients that range in abilities. Today I got the opportunity to become closer to D, D shared with me that he is a basketball player and a cowboy. D has the biggest, most genuine smile I have ever seen. Throughout the day he would just come up to me, smile really big, and then explain to me that he just smiled at me. That smile, D's smile made my day. Another opportunity that I had today was connecting with A. A is mainly non-verbal and uses a talker to have conversations with people. She doesn't let too many people come in her bubble. I was sitting across the table from A, when she motioned me to come over to her. I nervously walked over to her and took a seat. She put her hand out and waited for me to put a lego in her hand to then put it in the bucket. This is not a common occurrence for A to have with other people. I don't share these stories to show that I made an impact in their lives. Maybe I did, but I share these stories to show that anyone can interact with adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. They don't need your help, they don't need your pity, they just want a friend. There are a lot of misconceptions surrounding adults with developmental disabilities. This immersion trip has shown me so far that I was wrong about a lot of things. I am going to be much more aware of how I treat others. To not look at them and feel sorry for them because all of the people I have met so far are incredible and happy. I am very grateful to have been able to go on this immersion and better educate myself on the parts of our society that not everyone notices.\nBack\n  \nDance parties and journal entries\nDinner crew night 2!\nSawyer and Caley\nDance parties and journal entries\nDinner crew night 2!\nback\nnext",

Despite first day jitters, assumptions and expectations, today served as a perfect building block for the next two weeks. We are thrilled with anticipation for what this experience can be!\nAva Hughes~ I was honestly surprised at how small the class size was. I only had 4 elementary kids in this class. Off the bat I could tell who was shy and who was outgoing which then directed me to who I needed and wanted to build a connection with. Student E (*due to privacy reason we are referring to students by their first initial*) was new to Tennyson and seemed to be very competitive and have anger issues. Student J brought a toy from home and asked me to play with him. Student E asked to join but student J was saying he was \"untrustworthy\" and that he's \"scared\" of him and I asked why and he said because he \"has a lot of bad days.\" I observed them talking it out and coming to terms with the fact that student E is trying his best to be more gentle and earn student J's trust back. It was a very cute moment to see them solve their issues. However, a challenge that I faced was trying to build a connection but not being able to give them hugs or engage close to them. I had a couple kids ask me to give them a hug because they were sad but I had to turn them down. Honestly just the fact that they wanted to and have already opened up makes me happy.  I know this was only the first day but I'm so excited to see the amount of growth and impact I can have on these kids. \n\n\nCharlotte Ford~ Today immediately contradicted my expectations. First off, I was placed in the classroom with high school kids, which I had not prepared for. I'm glad that I didn't have much time to psych myself out for working with this age group because as I walked into the classroom I realized that it was a blessing to be with kids that I can more closely relate to. Despite this, I was awkward and consequently self-isolated for the first hour I spent in the classroom. No students acknowledged me so I assumed I had no real place in the classroom. This changed when I had my first interaction with Student A. I had the impression that she was annoyed by my presence but when I saw her eyeing me to help, I introduced myself and as we started to talk, I slowly watched her persona light up. This quick 20 minutes of friendship quickly challenged me later in the day when I had to observe her having a hard time being in the classroom. Student A had to be pulled out and I didn't see her for the rest of the day. It was frustrating for me to know that I had no control of this situation. I am setting my intention for tomorrow to reach out to her consistently to learn what she needs. Other than this, I got an extremely warm vibe from my classroom and found the rose of my day to be sitting down at lunch with the 6 of us that make up the classroom. We were able to be intimate and comfortable with each other and had light-hearted conversation. This inspires me to be present for the next two weeks because I found myself benefitting from their friendship even though I went in to this experience assuming they would only be benefitting from me.\nBack\n  \nSawyer, Charlotte, and Caley prepping dinner\nAva and Charlotte share a moment\nSawyer, Charlotte, and Caley prepping dinner\nAva and Charlotte share a moment\nback\nnext",

John Apel, SJ\n1/3/2023\nFr. John A. Apel, SJ died January 1, 2023 in St. Louis. He was 85 years old, a Jesuit for 66 years and a priest for 53 years. \n\nFr. Apel worked at Regis Jesuit High School in the early years of the Girls Division, helping shape the pastoral formation program of the young women who attended. He will be remembered in a Mass of Christian Burial at 10:30 am on Saturday, January 7, 2023, at St. Francis Xavier College Church in St. Louis. Visitation will precede the Mass in the church, beginning at 9:00 am Burial will be at Calvary Cemetery immediately after the funeral. Please read more for the full obituary. \n\nWe join our prayers with yours for the repose of Fr. Apel and for all those who loved him. May he rest in peace.\nJohn A. Apel was born February 22, 1937, in Marcus, Iowa, to John and Rosa (Dalhoff) Apel. In addition to his parents, he was preceded in death by his sister Rosalene Kessenich and his brother, N. James Bradley. He is survived by his sister Marie Gadd and several nieces and nephews. \n\nJohn entered the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) on August 8, 1956, at St. Stanislaus Seminary in Florissant, Mo., and pronounced his first vows there on August 15, 1958. He was ordained to the priesthood on June 6, 1969, at St. John's Parish, in Omaha, Neb., and pronounced final vows on April 22, 1976, at De Smet Jesuit High School in St. Louis. \n\nFr. Apel began teaching in 1963 at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City, Mo. Following his ordination, he was assigned to De Smet, where he taught chemistry and math. In 1979, he returned to Rockhurst, where he taught chemistry and theology and served as rector. \n\nIn 1985, he was assigned to St. Stephen's Mission on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, where he served in pastoral ministry to the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho for 12 years. \n\nHe returned to St. Louis as pastoral assistant for the former Missouri Province from 1997 to 2002. He then returned to the high school classroom at Regis Jesuit High School in Denver, where he taught Latin and science, while also serving in pastoral direction in the Girls Division and as superior of the Jesuit community. \n\nFollowing a sabbatical, he was assigned in 2008, as associate pastor at the St. Andrew Mission in Pendleton, Ore., where he remained for two years. From 2010 to 2012, he served in pastoral ministry on the Spokane Indian Reservation and Umatilla Indian Reservation, in Spokane, Wash.\n\nFr. Apel moved to the Jesuit Hall Community at Saint Louis University in 2012. He became a much-recognized and beloved figure on the Saint Louis University campus, as he made himself available to students. As his health declined last year, he began a ministry of prayer. \n\nFr. Apel earned a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry/math-physics at Spring Hill College in Mobile, Ala., and a master’s degree in theology at Saint Louis University. He did additional studies in science at the University of Colorado. \n\nWe remember with gratitude all that God has done through Fr. Apel’s life of service to God and God's people.\n\nMemorial gifts may be made to the USA Central and Southern Province of the Society of Jesus at 4511 West Pine Blvd., St. Louis, MO 63108 or through the province website at www.JesuitsCentralSouthern.org.\nBack\n  \nback\nnext",

Collection boxes are located in both the Boys and Girls Tradition Halls and the Dean's Office entrance in the Girls Division (glass box). We request that donated items be fully wrapped and/or sealed in original boxes. Girl Up is a partner organization of the United Nations Foundation focused on helping girls around the world feel empowered, gain access to education and find protection from violence. No one should have to choose between food and tampons, yet those experiencing homelessness often do. Your donation of feminine pads and/or tampons will go a long way to supporting women in need. \nRead More\nBOYS WRESTLING TAKES THIRD AND WINS THREE CONTINENTAL LEAGUE TITLES\n2/1/2023\nCongratulations to the Varsity Boys Wrestling Team on their strong third-place finish at the Continental League Championship on Saturday, January 28.

Organized by the Servant Leadership Class, RJ hosted a weeklong soccer-themed celebration including dress-down days, discounts at local restaurants, student-led fundraisers and a special burger review with our burger-loving Wish Kid David. \nThe week’s festivities culminated in an all-school Pep Rally on Thursday, April 27 in the Guy Gibbs '47 Gym where students and faculty cheered on David in a fun and competitive Mario Kart race (which he and his brother won!) and a raucous cheering contest to prove which grade level has the most school spirit (Seniors according to David!). The rally concluded with a faculty vs. students (plus David and his brother) soccer game where David's team was victorious, and he was presented with a World Cup soccer trophy to help commemorate his love for soccer and his time spent this week with our community.\n\nCongratulations to the entire RJ community for helping us reach our goal and generously raising more than $20,000 in support of David's wish. Funds raised from our two prior Wish Weeks have made it possible for Make-A-Wish to fulfill the wishes of eight kids battling life-threatening illnesses. Our third annual event is sure to help many more deserving kids. Thanks to the members of the Servant Leadership Class for their work in making this a memorable week for David and his family and an impactful experience for the entire RJ community.
